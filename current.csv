"2","Butler scores 47 points, Heat beat Celtics to force Game 7","e63d7424bb2a61e590b6e1a544c32f88","/article/miami-heat-boston-celtics-nba-mlb-sports-e63d7424bb2a61e590b6e1a544c32f88","BOSTON (AP) — Kyle Lowry listened politely while Jimmy Butler shared the credit for Miami’s Game 6 victory until his fellow All-Star took the humility too far and called his 47-point, elimination-avoiding performance “decent.”“It’s (expletive) incredible,” Lowry corrected him, apologizing for his language to the TV cameras in the back of the room and begging not to be fined by the league. “It’s incredible to have a guy like him next to me. I’ve played with some great players, and he’s one of the best.”Butler scored 47 points — a career playoff high and one of the best performances by a player facing elimination in NBA history — and the Heat forced the Eastern Conference finals to a decisive seventh game by beating the Boston Celtics 111-103 on Friday night.Ten years after LeBron James scored 45 points in a Game 6 in Boston en route to the first of the Heat’s back-to-back NBA titles, Butler scored 17 points in the fourth quarter to top him and send the series back to Miami.With a victory at home, the Heat would advance to the NBA Finals for the second time in three years.“This is the way it should be, with these two teams. It should have gone seven games,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I’m just really thrilled that our group gets an opportunity to compete in a Game 7 in front of our home crowd.”The winner of Game 7 on Sunday will advance to the NBA Finals against Golden State, which eliminated the Dallas Mavericks in five games Thursday night. Warriors forward Draymond Green said afterward that he expected to play the Celtics.In the most back-and-forth game of the series, Boston took a 97-94 lead on Derrick White’s 3-pointer with under five minutes to play — the first time all series the lead has changed hands in the fourth quarter. Lowry answered with a 3 and then added two free throws as Miami scored 11 of the next 13 points. Lowry finished with 18 points and 10 assists before fouling out with 2:18 left. Butler made 16 of 29 shots — including 4 of 8 from 3-point range — and all 11 free throws.“He came out from the jump and kind of put his imprint on the game,” White said. “That’s just who he’s been his whole career, constantly attacking and doing what he does to help his team win. We knew it was coming, and we’ve got to do a better job in Game 7.”Jayson Tatum had 30 points and nine rebounds for Boston, and White came off the bench to score 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter. The Celtics are trying to reach the finals for the first time since 2010, two years after the New Big Three of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen won the franchise’s 17th NBA title — a record since tied by the Lakers.“It’s no secret: It’s Game 7, trip to the NBA Finals, a lot on the line,” Tatum said. “We know what’s at stake. We know how much this means to everybody.” Jaylen Brown scored 20 points for Boston, missing a pair of free throws with the game tied at 99 after Lowry fouled out. Brown fouled out himself on a charge offensive that was assessed after a challenge on a missed dunk with 13 seconds left and the Celtics down by four. AVOIDING ELIMINATIONButler’s 47 points were the seventh-most in NBA history for a player facing elimination. Elgin Baylor had 61 against Boston in Game 5 of the 1962 finals. Wilt Chamberlain topped 50 three times, Sleepy Floyd had 50 against the Lakers in 1987 and Jamal Murray scored 50 against Utah in 2020. It was also the third-most to stave off elimination against the Celtics. In addition to Baylor, Chamberlain had 50 in Game 5 of the East finals in 1960. James’ 45 against Boston in Game 6 of the 2012 conference finals set the stage for a Game 7 win in Miami. The Heat are hoping Butler’s performance can do the same. “I get it, people can easily draw the comparisons between the two,” Spoelstra said. “That’s a different era. That’s a different team. I want our guys to embrace this moment.” IN AND OUTMiami guard Tyler Herro missed his third straight game with a strained groin, costing the team its No. 2 scorer. Kyle Lowry (hamstring), Max Strus (hamstring) and P.J. Tucker (knee) had been listed as questionable but were in the starting lineup. Boston’s Marcus Smart (sprained right ankle) and Robert Williams III (sore knee) tested their injuries pregame and were also in the lineup. TIP-INSHeat: Butler had 14 points, five rebounds and four assists in the first. He scored or assisted on 24 of Miami’s 29 points in the quarter.Celtics: Red Sox slugger David Ortiz, who was inducted into the ballclub’s Hall of Fame on Thursday night, was courtside. Ortiz threw out a ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park earlier in the evening. Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez was also at the game, wearing his World Series ring.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

He has been an assistant to Mike Budenholzer with the Milwaukee Bucks since 2018, and he played a significant role in their run to the 2021 NBA title.Ham will be the successor to Frank Vogel, who was fired one day after the Lakers wrapped up one of the most disappointing seasons in NBA history by going 33-49 and missing the playoffs.The Lakers flopped despite another impressive season from LeBron James, who welcomed his new head coach on social media even before the move was publicly announced.“So damn EXCITED!!!!!!!!” James tweeted. “Congrats and welcome Coach DHam!!”Ham will be the 15th Black coach currently in the NBA, the most ever at one time.Ham was a player development assistant coach with Kobe Bryant’s Lakers from 2011-13 on the staffs of head coaches Mike Brown and Mike D’Antoni. Ham then had a five-year stint on the Atlanta Hawks’ staff under Budenholzer, developing a reputation as an effective communicator with versatile tactical knowledge.Budenholzer’s staffs with the Hawks also included Taylor Jenkins, Quin Snyder and Kenny Atkinson, who all became NBA head coaches.Vogel led the Lakers to the franchise’s 17th title exactly 18 months before his firing. He failed to coax a winning season out of a veteran-laden roster led by James, oft-injured Anthony Davis and newcomer Russell Westbrook, who had a dismal first season with his hometown team. Westbrook is under contract for another season with the Lakers.Ham played eight seasons in the NBA and won a championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004 before moving into coaching in 2008. The Michigan native played collegiately at Texas Tech.___AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

LOUIS (AP) — Colorado coach Jared Bednar had been looking for a little extra aggressiveness from veteran center Darren Helm.Bednar got his wish on Friday night.Helm scored with 5.6 seconds left and Darcy Kuemper stopped 18 shots as the Avalanche finished off their second-round series with a 3-2 win over the St. Louis Blues in Game 6 on Friday night.“We wanted him to be assertive and not so safe,” Bednar said.J.T. Compher scored twice for Colorado, which advanced to the Western Conference finals for first time since 2002. The Avalanche had been eliminated in the second round each of the past three years.Colorado opens the series against Edmonton on Tuesday night in Denver.Jordan Kyrou and Justin Faulk scored for St. Louis. and Ville Husso made 36 saves. On the winning goal, the 35-year-old Helm blasted a shot from the faceoff circle that went over the glove of Husso.“We had three guys going hard to the net,” Helm said. “I was just kind of trailing. The pass bounced off the side wall. I just wanted to get the puck on the net and it found its way.”It was the second series-clinching goal for Helm. As a member of the Detroit Red Wings, he nailed down the Western Conference championship with an overtime goal in Game 5 against Chicago, exactly 13 years ago.“There’s no other guy that deserves it as much as he does,” Colorado forward Gabriel Landeskog said. “You talk about his work ethic, but he’s the guy that comes to the rink with a smile on his face, gets along with everybody.”Kuemper, who missed part of the first round series against Nashville with an eye injury, improved to 6-2. He also enjoyed watching Helm record the biggest tally of the series.“A super-clutch goal,” Kuemper said. “It’s always fun to see someone like Darren, who plays the game so hard, (but) always doesn’t get rewarded with the points, to come up with a big goal like that is really special.”Compher, who had been held scoreless over the Avalanche’s first nine games of the playoffs, broke free at the perfect time. He pounced on the rebound of a shot from Josh Manson to tie the score 1-1 early in the second period. Compher then tied it 2-2 on a wrist shot from the faceoff dot with 9:41 left in the third.Husso, who have up 13 goals on 93 shots over the previous three games, rebounded with a much stronger effort.Colorado dominated play for long stretches, but could not solve Husso, who regained his job after Jordan Binnington went down with a lower body injury in Game 3. Husso robbed Nazem Kadri from close range early in the third period.Husso had a 37-save shutout in a Game 1 win over Minnesota in the first round.Faulk scored late in the first period on a wrist shot from between the circles. He sailed into the slot before taking a pass from Robert Thomas. The drive grazed off the arm of Kuemper. It was Faulk’s first goal of the postseason after handing out seven assists.Kyrou also missed the net on a breakaway in the second period and had shot from close range stopped by Manson in the defensive play of the game after Kuemper was out of position.Kyrou then converted on a 2-on-1 off a pass from Brayden Schenn to put the Blues up 2-1 at 9:34 of the second period.“We feel like we’re a good team and we let that series slip,” Schenn said.St. Louis coach Craig Berube added: “It’s tough, a tough way to end it. That’s the way it goes. Our guys battle hard.”The Blues forced a Game 5 by beating Colorado 5-4 in overtime on Wednesday on a goal by Tyler Bozak.The Avalanche bounced back from that setback with an impressive effort.“From the drop of the puck, we were ready to go,” Bednar said. “You could tell the belief was there.”THE GREAT ONEWayne Gretzky attended the contest. Gretzky, who played 18 games for the Blues in the 1995-96 season, has a house in St. Louis.

"2","Reds’ Pham slaps Giants’ Pederson over fantasy football beef","c733be15000cc5c877856cfaa367396e","/article/mlb-sports-cincinnati-reds-san-francisco-giants-c733be15000cc5c877856cfaa367396e","CINCINNATI (AP) — San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson said Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham slapped him prior to Friday’s series opener over a dispute about their fantasy football league.While the Giants warmed up in the outfield, Pham confronted Pederson and smacked him in the face before the pair was separated. Major League Baseball is investigating, and Pham agreed to be scratched from Cincinnati’s lineup shortly before first pitch pending results of the inquiry.Pederson said after the Reds’ 5-1 victory that he was accused of cheating for placing a player on injured reserve and replacing him with a free agent in a fantasty football league. Pederson said the player he put on IR had been ruled out for that week, which made it a legal move. He said Pham had executed essentially the same maneuver with his own team.“I sent a screenshot of the rules, how it says that if a player’s ruled out, you’re allowed to put him on the IR and that’s all I was doing,” Pederson. “He literally did the same thing. That was basically all of it.” Pederson said he had no advance notice that Pham might confront him during the series in Cincinnati. “There was no argument, he kind of came up and said, ‘You remember from last year?’ and I said, ‘Fantasy football?’” Pederson recalled. The Giants outfielder said he didn’t retaliate after being slapped, and he has no plans to re-engage Pham while the team is in Cincinnati. “Violence isn’t the answer. It’s over as far as I’m concerned,” Pederson said. “I won’t talk to him. I don’t think he wants to talk to me, I don’t know. It was a weird interaction.”Pham threatened violence to settle an on-field score with San Diego’s Luke Voit in April, challenging the slugger to a fight after Voit injured Reds catcher Tyler Stephenson with a hard, ugly slide into home.“If Luke wants to settle it, I get down really well,” Pham said. “Anything. Muay Thai, whatever. Like I said, I’ve got an owner here who will let me use his facility.”The scuffle was witnessed by reporters and occurred before fans entered the ballpark.Reds manager David Bell refused to comment on the incident, and Pham refused to speak on the record with reporters. “Major League Baseball is investigating it, and until that’s complete, I’m probably not going to say much on it,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","Column: NHL playoffs best show in sports; NBA a snoozer","4d8b00ef51a5470834bedddc26c6c378","/article/miami-heat-boston-celtics-dallas-mavericks-nhl-nba-4d8b00ef51a5470834bedddc26c6c378","If you’re looking for some excitement, forget about the NBA playoffs.They’ve been a total snooze, filled with blowouts and only a handful of must-see moments.The lack of drama has been especially striking when compared to the NHL postseason, which has produced one thrill after another.Games 7s? Check. Overtime goals? Check. Fierce rivalries? Check.Once again, hockey’s playoffs are proving to be the most compelling show in all of sports, leaving hoops and most everything else in their wake.Just check out that game late Thursday night, when the Edmonton Oilers won the Battle of Alberta with a 5-4 overtime victory over the Calgary Flames. The Western Conference semifinal only went to five games, making it a bit of an outlier for these Stanley Cup playoffs, which have featured five of 11 series going the seven-game max — and two of those decided by overtime goals in Game 7.Still, the Oilers-Flames showdown produced plenty of “Did you see that?!” moments, including a stunning stretch in the decisive contest when the teams combined for four goals — two by each squad — in a 71-second span.That was the fastest four goals in NHL playoff history, breaking a 46-year-old record.“It was crazy,” said Edmonton’s Leon Draisaitl, who is tied with teammate Connor McDavid for the playoff scoring lead at 26 points. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”The only regret for hockey fans was this series not lasting a couple of more games. Calgary’s only win in the series was a hugely entertaining 9-6 shootout in Game 1, when the Flames squandered a four-goal lead but bounced back for the victory.After that, the Oilers rallied from a two-goal deficit to capture Game 2, and recovered again to take Game 4 with two late goals after the Flames wiped out Edmonton’s 3-0 lead with a trio of scores in less than 2 minutes. Then came Game 5, which proved to be a most fitting capper.What a series! There was another exhilarating finish Friday night, when Darren Helm scored with 5.6 seconds left in regulation to give Colorado a series-ending 3-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues, sending the Avalanche to the conference final against the Oilers.Now, let’s venture over to the the opposite end of the emotional scale.The NBA playoffs.Roughly an hour before McDavid scored the overtime clincher for the Oilers, the Golden State Warriors locked up their spot in the NBA Finals with a ho-hum win over the Dallas Mavericks that was a microcosm of the entire basketball postseason.The Warriors raced out to a 17-point halftime lead and went on cruise control the rest of the way. The Mavericks trailed by as many as 25, cut the margin down to eight late in the third period, but couldn’t get over the hump in a 120-110 setback.Yawn.In the Eastern Conference, there was finally a bit of back-and-forth as the top-seeded Miami Heat forced a decisive Game 7 by gutting out a 111-103 victory in Boston over the Celtics on Friday night. No matter who comes out on top Sunday, it feels like we’re all losers. Four of the first five games were decided by double-digit margins, including 20- and 25-point blowouts. Even Game 3, which wound up a 109-103 win for Miami, wasn’t really that close. The Heat bolted to a 26-point lead in the first half and withstood a furious Boston comeback.Forty-two of the first 80 games in these NBA playoffs were decided by double digits — with 15 of those at least a 20-point victory and another seven that weren’t even remotely competitive, finishing with margins of at least 30 points.Stunningly, one of those max blowouts was Game 7 of the West semifinals, when the top-seeded Phoenix Suns — who had the league’s best record during the regular season at 64-18 — were blitzed 123-90 on their home court by the Mavericks.That came after a series that may have looked somewhat close from afar, given it was among just three of the 14 series to go the full seven games, but that would be a misnomer.Even before the Game 7 rout, three other games had been decided by at least 20 points. Not once did a game go down to the final possession.Celtics coach Boston coach Ime Udoka had some thoughts on the NBA”s sorry state of affairs in the postseason.“A big part of it is the scoring nowadays,” he said. “Teams go on crazy runs. Defense, depending on the team, is more of a luxury at times. It’s not always the premium with every team. A lot of times you have these shootouts, and they can get ugly pretty quickly.”Indeed, the league has devolved into a rather one-dimensional offensive style, with wins and losses essentially coming down to which team gets hot beyond the 3-point arc.Another theory that’s been advanced is the lack of additional rest days between games, especially when much of that time can be eaten up by travel. Whatever the case, this is hardly a new conundrum for the NBA. Last year’s postseason was slightly more competitive, but the average margin was still 12.5 points (compared to 13.0 this year) and well over half the games (49 of 85) were decided by double-figure margins.And let’s not forget TNT analyst and NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley expressing his disgust with the lack of competitive playoff games a full five years ago.“Thank God for the NHL playoffs,” he griped back in 2017. “That’s what I would be watching in the back instead of some of these blowouts.” That still applies today.Let’s all give thanks for the Stanley Cup playoffs.And the remote control that allows us to flip away from the NBA postseason.___Paul Newberry is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

"2","Giants’ Kapler refusing to take field for anthem in protest","02e297bb2bee8f00d1605c5f49ce3d8e","/article/mlb-politics-sports-texas-shootings-02e297bb2bee8f00d1605c5f49ce3d8e","CINCINNATI (AP) — San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler said Friday he will refuse to take the field for the national anthem in a protest over the nation’s political direction following this week’s school shooting in Texas.“I don’t plan on coming out for the anthem going forward until I feel better about the direction of our country,” Kapler said before a series opener at Cincinnati. “I don’t expect it to move the needle necessarily. It’s just something that I feel strongly enough about to take that step.” Kapler said he needs more time to consider specific actions he might suggest be taken to prevent more tragedies of this type, such as stronger gun control laws.Kapler said that on the day of the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, “I knew that I was not in my best place mentally and I knew that it was in connection with some of the hypocrisies for the national anthem and how it coincided with the moment of silence and how two things didn’t synch up well for me, but I couldn’t make sense of it in real time and it took me a couple of days to pull all my thoughts together.”Only seven Giants were on the field — two coaches in front of the dugout, four players along left-field line and an athletic trainer standing alongside them — when “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played before Kapler and Reds manager David Bell exchanged lineup cards. The game started after a 2-hour, 8-minute rain delay.Earlier in the day, Kapler used his personal blog to discuss the deaths of the 19 children and two teachers killed in Uvalde. In a post titled “Home of the Brave, ” Kapler wrote: “We elect our politicians to represent our interests. Immediately following this shooting, we were told we needed locked doors and armed teachers. We were given thoughts and prayers. We were told it could have been worse, and we just need love. “But we weren’t given bravery, and we aren’t free. ... We aren’t free when politicians decide that the lobbyist and gun industries are more important than our children’s freedom to go to school without needing bulletproof backpacks and active shooter drills.”Kapler went on the write: “Every time I place my hand over my heart and remove my hat, I’m participating in a self congratulatory glorification of the only country where these mass shootings take place. On Wednesday, I walked out onto the field, I listened to the announcement as we honored the victims in Uvalde. I bowed my head. I stood for the national anthem. Metallica riffed on City Connect guitars. My brain said drop to a knee; my body didn’t listen. I wanted to walk back inside; instead I froze. I felt like a coward. I didn’t want to call attention to myself. I didn’t want to take away from the victims or their families. ... “But I am not OK with the state of this country. I wish I hadn’t let my discomfort compromise my integrity. I wish that I could have demonstrated what I learned from my dad, that when you’re dissatisfied with your country, you let it be known through protest.”Kapler has protested during the anthem in the past. In July 2020, before the start of the virus-shortened 60-game season, Kapler joined outfielder Jaylin Davis in taking a knee ahead of an exhibition game against the Oakland Athletics. Davis was making a statement about racial and social issues facing the country. Fellow outfielders Mike Yastrzemski and Austin Slater also chose to kneel. So did first base coach Antoan Richardson, while shortstop Brandon Crawford stood between Davis and Richardson with a hand on each man’s shoulder.Kapler’s latest comments came a day after the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays used their social media accounts during the game between the teams to spread information about how gun violence affects American life.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport"
"2","Colonial lead cut from 8 to 3: Scheffler, Stallings, Hossler","a4d5c0359778561bfa2262125212e8f2","/article/pga-championships-sports-dallas-beau-hossler-scott-stallings-a4d5c0359778561bfa2262125212e8f2","FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — This has been a good week in North Texas for Scott Stallings, first qualifying for the U.S. Open that will be played less than an hour from where he was born and now sharing the lead at Colonial with top-ranked Scottie Scheffler and Beau Hossler. Stallings shot a 6-under 64 without a bogey on a relatively calm Friday at Hogan’s Alley. That put the Massachusetts-born and 206th-ranked player in the world at 9-under 131 with Dallas-area resident Scheffler and Hossler, both former University of Texas golfers who had bogey-free 65s. Scheffler, in one of the last groups of the day after Stallings and Hossler played in the morning wave, tied them with a 14-foot birdie putt at the par-4 17th and saved par at No. 18 after his final drive went left into the rough. “I think I needed to put up a good score with the wind being real low and the greens being not crazy firm,” said Scheffler, without a bogey so far this week. “Yeah, I love that stat. It’s a lot of fun. ... I kept the stress off myself for the most part.” It was calm pretty much throughout the day Friday. But hot and breezy conditions are expected for the weekend rounds at the Charles Schwab Classic, with gusts around 30 mph and temperatures in the mid- to upper-90s in the forecast. Scheffler and Hossler were among the Colonial-record eight players to share the 18-hole lead at 66. Stallings began the second round as one of the seven others within a stroke of that. Patrick Reed matched his opening 66 with another and was alone in fourth place at 8-under 132. Pat Perez (66) and Chris Kirk (67), the 2015 Colonial champion who hasn’t won on the PGA Tour since, were at 133.After missing the cut at last week’s PGA Championship like Scheffler did, the 37-year-old Stallings went to Dallas to play in a 36-hole qualifier Monday for the U.S. Open next month in Brookline, Massachusetts. He shot 8 under and placed 11th to get into his third U.S. Open and 12th major overall.“That was a huge goal, probably the biggest goal I had of the year, is to play the Open up there,” Stallings said Friday. “Probably the only time in my career I’ll have an opportunity to play a major championship in New England where at least half my family lives, my sister lives just down the road.”Stallings had eight birdies and five bogeys in his first round at Colonial. There were no bogeys on Friday, and no birdies until four in the middle of the round — at Nos. 8, 9, 11 and 12. The three-time PGA Tour winner added another at No. 14, then finished by rolling in a 28-foot birdie putt.Having the momentum of qualifying for the U.S. Open “carry over into the week was nice to see, and take advantage of a day that we definitely haven’t seen very often here,” said Stallings, who was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, but now lives in Tennessee, where he went to school at Tennessee Tech. Jordan Spieth, another local favorite and No. 9 in the world, shot 66. He birdied his first two holes and had a 35-foot birdie putt when finishing on the ninth hole. Spieth was tied for 12th at 5 under. The 2016 Colonial winner, Spieth was the runner-up at Hogan’s Alley for the third time last year, when he led after each of the first three rounds before a final-group showdown with Jason Kokrak the last day. Defending champ Kokrak is even par through two rounds this year.Fifth-ranked Justin Thomas missed the cut at 3 over a week after winning the PGA Championship for the second time. His 72 on Friday included going 6 over in a four-hole stretch midway through the round — bogeys at No. 7, 8 and 10, and triple-bogey 7 at No. 9 without going in the water.It is the second year in a row the PGA winner played the following week at Colonial and missed the cut. Last year it was Phil Mickelson.Hossler, in his 136th PGA Tour event and still looking for his first victory, had a more steady second round after his exciting finish Thursday, when he had two eagle 2s his last four holes, though both hole-outs came immediately after bogeys. “Certainly, yesterday was more of an up-and-down round. Today felt frankly, never really stress-free, but as stress-free as it’s going to get,” Hossler said. “It felt like I was in play. I never was that out of position.”Nick Taylor, ranked 244th in the world, took the solo lead for the second day in a row. The Canadian dropped into a share of the first-round lead with a bogey on his final hole, and Friday shot 6-over 41 on his final nine holes after five birdies in his first nine holes to make his turn at 9 under. __More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

But Moana Pasifika surged back with tries to Willy Havili and Joe ’Apikotoa and didn’t relinquish the lead.Peter Samu’s try in the final minute came too late from the Brumbies, who retain a home quarterfinal but drop a place from third to fourth.“What a finish,” Kepu said. “I haven’t got any words, I’m just so proud of the boys. It just shows that when we express ourselves, we’re physical, we’re elusive and we’ve got X-factor.”In the third match Saturday at Sydney, fullback Zarn Sullivan kicked a dropped goal a minute after the siren sounded to give the Auckland-based Blues a 20-17 win over the New South Wales Waratahs, the Blues’ record 13th win in a row.Lock Luke Romano scored a try with six minutes remaining to give the Blues the lead before the Waratahs tied it. Earlier, winger Mark Nawaqanitawase scored a pair of tries seven minutes apart to give the Waratahs a 14-10 lead.The Waratahs will play the Hamilton-based Chiefs next weekend in New Zealand in a quarterfinal.The Blues clinched first place last week and will play either the Highlanders or the Western Force in a quarterfinal at Auckland next weekend. The Force can only advance to the playoffs if they beat the Wellington-based Hurricanes in a later match Saturday at Perth and hope that the Rebels beat the Highlanders in Melbourne on Sunday.Earlier, the Fijian Drua came close to finishing their first season with a victory but lost 35-34 to the Hamilton-based Chiefs.The match was played in front of a packed house at Churchill Park in Lautoka, Fiji. Every inch of the ground was filled and spectators occupied every tree or other vantage point overlooking the ground to see what turned out to be one of the most compelling matches of the season.The Chiefs led 35-13 with only 14 minutes remaining in the match and they must have felt the job was done in hot, humid and sapping conditions.The Drua launched an extraordinary comeback, scoring three tries in the last 10 minutes to make the match a cliff-hanger. “I thought we’d played our one and only get out of jail free card against the Rebels a couple of weeks ago but it turns out we’ve got two,” Chiefs captain Brad Weber said. “We just feel a sense of relief more than anything. Man, hats off to the Drua.”Roared on by the crowd, the Drua hit back first with a magnificent counter-attacking try to Kalaveti Ravouvou and added another five minutes later to Apisalome Vota. The Chiefs began to feel pressure at 35-27.The stadium erupted when replacement prop Timoci Sauvoli scored under the posts with a minute on the clock and the conversion cut the Chiefs’ lead to a single point.The Drua gained a final possession but the match ended before they could make their rally a winning one.“In a few years, this is going to be a seriously tough place to play, especially for New Zealand teams,” Weber said. “I think it’s about 1 degree (Celsius) in Hamilton and you come over here and it’s 30 degrees with humidity, so it’s not easy.” ___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

"2","Blue Jays rally in 9th inning for 4-3 victory over Angels","621845ec003fe9ad501eb4ea16c7468a","/article/mlb-sports-baseball-los-angeles-toronto-621845ec003fe9ad501eb4ea16c7468a","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Lourdes Gurriel Jr. didn’t have his cleanest fielding performance. He came through at the plate when was needed the most, though.Which kind of sums up the Toronto Blue Jays Friday night.Gurriel had one of Toronto’s three errors, but his single in the ninth inning helped score Alejandro Kirk with the winning run as the Blue Jays rallied for a 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels.The Angels had only error, but it was costly. Gurriel lined a base hit to right field to move Kirk to third, and he scored when Juan Lagares misplayed the ball and had it bounce off his glove.“I thought it was gonna be hard for Kirk to score on that, but once I saw that he bobbled it I knew that we had a good chance to score right there,” Gurriel said.Gurriel had three hits and drove in a run, while Kirk had two hits. Kirk led off the ninth with a single to center against Raisel Iglesias (1-3) and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt, setting the table for Gurriel.The Blue Jays’ errors included a throwing miscue by Gurriel on a double by Mike Trout, but they were able to get their seventh win in the last 10 games. “We didn’t play good defense at the beginning, but we made the right moves and the pitching was good,” manager Charlie Montoyo said.Jared Walsh and Tyler Wade homered for the Angels, who were missing injured Shohei Ohtani and Anthony Rendon from the starting lineup. Wade was in the lineup at third base in Rendon’s absence.Ohtani came on as a pinch-hitter in the ninth but was struck out by Jordan Romano, who earned his 15th save. Trevor Richards (2-0) got the win.Toronto starter Alek Manoah struck out a season-high nine but allowed three runs on seven hits, including two home runs. With a fastball-slider combination, the right-hander made Angels’ hitters swing and miss 19 times.“The game plan past couple outings has been putting guys away with the slider. I yanked a few, but overall the game plan worked,” he said.Los Angeles’ Chase Silseth went 4 1/3 innings and yielded two runs on six hits. The Angels have dropped three straight.“We just aren’t hitting up to our standards right now,” manager Joe Maddon said. “They got us at the end and they beat some of our better relief pitchers.” Toronto’s Bo Bichette led off the second inning with a ground-rule double into the right-field corner. He advanced to third on Teoscar Hernandez’s base hit and scored when Kirk grounded into a double play.The Angels responded in the bottom of the inning when Andrew Velazquez’s bloop single down the left-field line drove in Luis Rengifo to tie it at 1. Rengifo got aboard when he lined a hit to center and advanced to second when Raimel Tapia had it roll between his legs for an error.Walsh hit his 10th homer in the third inning when he hit a changeup from Manoah that barely got over the wall in center. Toronto led off the fifth with three straight hits, including an RBI double from Gurriel to even it at 2-all.Los Angeles regained the lead in the home half on Wade’s solo shot to right. It was Wade’s first homer since Sept. 26, 2020, when he was with the New York Yankees.Toronto tied it in the seventh on pinch-hitter Matt Chapman’s RBI single.CLOSE CALLTapia was on third base with one out in the fifth when George Springer hit a line drive that was foul but hit Tapia in the leg. After being looked at by trainers, Tapia stayed in the game before being lifted for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning.TOO STRATEGIC?Toronto had four outfielders on most of Trout’s at-bats, with second baseman Cavan Biggio shifting to right field. Trout made them pay with a double down the left-field line in the fifth inning.Left fielder Gurriel threw the ball to second but no one was covering, allowing Trout to move to third on the error. Trout appeared to give the Angels a 4-2 lead when he scored on a fielder’s choice, but replay overturned the call and ruled that Bichette’s throw to Kirk made it in time.Montoyo said after the game that first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. should have followed Trout to second to make sure the base was covered.TRAINER’S ROOMBlue Jays: LHP Tayler Saucedo (right hip discomfort) continued his throwing progression by going from 120 feet.Angels: Ohtani was out of the lineup due to back discomfort. ... Rendon had an MRI on his right wrist after feeling increased soreness.UP NEXTBlue Jays: LHP Yusei Kikuchi (2-1, 3.47 ERA) has held opposing hitters to a .111 batting average in four May starts.Angels: RHP Michael Lorenzen (5-2, 3.05 ERA) has won his last two starts.

The way the Dodgers are hitting the ball these days, a bad day is relative.“It seemed a little slow,” Betts said. “But if you take a look from your point of view, yeah, it makes sense, we scored six. That should win a game.”And it did. Again.The Dodgers continued their recent roll, winning for the 11th time in 13 games. Edwin Ríos and Betts hit back-to-back homers in the second inning and Trea Turner added a solo shot in the sixth.It was the second win of the series for the Dodgers, who had a season-high 24 hits in a 14-1 victory on Thursday. This game wasn’t as lopsided, but Los Angeles was still in control for most of the night.Batting ninth in the stacked Dodgers lineup, Ríos pulled a fastball from Madison Bumgarner over the right-field wall for a three-run homer and a 3-0 lead. It was his sixth homer this season. The 28-year-old has struggled to find consistent playing time over the past four seasons because the Dodgers are so deep, but has usually produced when his number is called. He has 19 homers in 242 career at-bats and is starting to force his way into the lineup on a more regular basis.“I’m always ready,” Rios said. “It feels good knowing when you’re coming to the field that you’re going to play. Definitely soaking it in and trying to take advantage of it.”Betts followed with a no-doubter to left that pushed the advantage to 4-0.It was obvious Bumgarner (2-3) didn’t have his best stuff. The lefty struggled with command for much of the night — even throwing a pitch behind Justin Turner — and gave up five runs over six innings.The Dodgers have won 11 of 13 and lead the National League with a 31-14 record.Los Angeles rookie Ryan Pepiot gave up one run over 4 1/3 innings in his third big league start. The right-hander threw four scoreless innings before running into trouble in the fifth. The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with one out, but reliever Brusdar Graterol (1-2) got out of the jam, allowing just one run to score on a sacrifice fly.The D-backs rallied in the ninth off closer Craig Kimbrel, but couldn’t finish the job. Josh Rojas had an RBI double and Christian Walker knocked in another with a run-scoring groundout to pull within 6-4, but Kimbrel got David Peralta on a game-ending groundout.“We just dug ourselves too big of a hole,” D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. “We fought back, made some noise in the ninth, had the right guys in the right spot with runners out there, but just couldn’t get the big hit.”BIG BETTSBetts’ homer was his 13th this season and kept up a sensational stretch. He’s hit safely in 28 of 33 games since April 19 and entered Friday batting .341 with 27 RBIs and 41 runs scored over the same stretch. ODDS AND ENDSDodgers: Manager Dave Roberts was not at the game. He returned to Southern California for his daughter’s graduation and is expected back Saturday. Bench coach Bob Geren managed the team Friday. ... RHP Phil Bickford was optioned to Triple-A to make room for Pepiot on the roster.Diamondbacks: Called up LHP Tyler Holton from Triple-A Reno and optioned RHP Luis Frias to Triple-A. ...

Earlier in the day, he used his personal blog to discuss the deaths of the 19 children and two teachers killed in Uvalde. In a post titled “Home of the Brave,” Kapler wrote: “We elect our politicians to represent our interests. Immediately following this shooting, we were told we needed locked doors and armed teachers. We were given thoughts and prayers. We were told it could have been worse, and we just need love. “But we weren’t given bravery, and we aren’t free. ... We aren’t free when politicians decide that the lobbyist and gun industries are more important than our children’s freedom to go to school without needing bulletproof backpacks and active shooter drills.”Meanwhile, Major League Baseball is investigating after Giants outfielder Joc Pederson said Reds outfieded Tommy Pham slapped him prior to Friday’s opener over a dispute about their fantasy football league.Pederson said after the Reds’ 5-1 victory that he was accused of cheating for placing a player on injured reserve and replacing him with a free agent. Pederson said the player he put on IR had been ruled out for that week, which made it a legal move. He said Pham had executed essentially the same maneuver with his own team.“There was no argument, he kind of came up and said, ‘You remember from last year?’ and I said, ‘Fantasy football?’” Pederson recalled. OLD FRIENDSCorey Kluber faces his former Yankees teammates for the first time since signing with the rival Rays, and he’ll square off with New York ace Gerrit Cole. Kluber pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees on May 19, 2021 againt another of his former teams, the Texas Rangers. The two-time Cy Young Award winner signed an $8 million, one-year deal with Tampa Bay and is 1-2 with a 4.42 ERA in eight starts.Cole is coming off what he termed a “peculiar” outing against Baltimore in which he allowed five runs but also struck out 11 with no walks over eight innings.HERE’S JOHNNYJohnny Cueto takes a spotless 0.00 ERA into his third start with the White Sox, although the 36-year-old is yet to get a decision.

The three-run homer was a big moment for the designated hitter, who has mostly struggled in his first season with the Padres. Two innings later, Wil Myers drove in Manny Machado with a shattered-bat single and the Padres won 4-3.The Padres’ slumbering offense finally came to life in the sixth and Voit punctuated it with his homer on a 2-2 pitch. It was his first since May 11 and third overall.“I’ve been grinding and needed to step up,” Voit said. “We’ve been struggling with runners in scoring position. It felt good, especially after my first two at-bats. I was just getting too big and I just need to slow the game down sometimes. This game’s already hard enough.“Sometimes you’ve just got to take every positive out of this game. I finally got a big situation to come up and just slow the game down and look for a pitch that I knew I was going to get and I finally got it, so it was good.”Voit said he knew that Crowe likely would follow up a sinker with a slider. “I was kind of staying with that approach the whole time and it worked out,” Voit said. “I just did my homework on him.”The Padres hadn’t hit a home run since Machado’s solo shot in a 2-1 win at San Francisco last Saturday.Jurickson Profar singled off Carlos Quintana leading off the sixth and Eric Hosmer reached on an error by first baseman Josh VanMeter. Hosmer was originally called out, but the Padres challenged and the call was overturned because although the throw beat Hosmer to the bat, VanMeter didn’t get his foot on the base. It was first ruled a single, but later changed to an error.“We didn’t do a whole lot there for five innings,” manager Bob Melvin said. “It kind of felt like the last couple of games we were a little dormant offensively. But it just goes to show you, you stay with it, you get a couple guys on base, and one swing of the bat by a guy like Luke can really turn the game around.”Machado, who came in with an NL-best .357 average, started the winning rally with a leadoff walk against Duane Underwood Jr. (0-1) and took third on Eric Hosmer’s single to right-center. Myers brought in Machado with a single to center as his bat shattered. Nabil Crismatt (3-0) pitched a perfect eighth for the win and Taylor Rogers pitched a perfect ninth for his 17th save. The Pirates took a 3-0 lead against Manaea on Bryan Reynolds’ homer with one out in the first, his sixth, and Diego Castillo’s two-run double with one out in the in the fourth. Manaea walked Ben Gamel and VanMeter ahead of Castillo’s double.Manaea allowed three runs and four hits in seven innings, struck out five and walked three.UMP SWITCHSecond base umpire CB Bucknor jogged off the field during the top of the seventh and returned before the bottom of the inning wearing his protective gear and took over for plate umpire Jeff Nelson, who left the game. Melvin said Nelson had a bad back.TRAINER’S ROOMPirates: 1B Michael Chavis left in the sixth with discomfort in his left forearm. ... 1B Yoshi Tsutsugo was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Wednesday with a strained lumbar muscle. ...

Kapler refused to take the field for the national anthem, a demonstration of his frustration with the country’s political direction following this week’s school shooting in Texas.Meanwhile, the Reds’ Pham slapped Pederson on the field before the game, alleging the Giants outfielder cheated in their fantasy football league. Major League Baseball is investigating, and Pham was scratched after a pregame rain delay of 2 hours, 8 minutes pending the results of that inquiry.“This is a turn the page situation, first game of a long road trip, this isn’t something that gets us down for a minute,” Kapler said. “We understand we didn’t play our best baseball. We’ll shower it off and be ready to compete.”Kapler endured an embarassing moment in the eighth, when he brought in left-hander Jake McGee from the bullpen, then had to replace him because McGee wasn’t on San Francisco’s lineup card. McGee was reinstated from the IL before the game but had to exit after beginning his warmup tosses on the mound. Left-hander Jose Alvarez then entered the game for San Francisco. “Our entire staff is incredibly detailed and pays very close attention,” Kapler said. “There was a lot going on today and we (messed) it up.”Ashcraft (1-0) pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings in his second big league start. He threw first-pitch strikes to his first 12 batters, limiting San Francisco to four hits and two walks while striking out two. “Graham is tough to hit,” Reds manager David Bell said. “Getting ahead with movement. It makes for a tough at-bat. He had one or two strikeouts, but mostly ground balls. That shows the kind of stuff he has.” Matt Reynolds had an RBI double in the third and later scored on a check-swing single by Tyler Stephenson. Brandon Drury added a solo homer in the fifth, his eighth of the season.Carlos Rodon (4-4) allowed three runs on seven hits. The Giants scored two combined runs over his last two starts, both defeats. He said the timing of the rain didn’t help. “I don’t think I found out (about the delay) until about 6:12 and the game was at 6:40, I was ready to go,” Rondon said. “It’s just part of the gig. I just had to stay focused. It didn’t show on the mound, obviously.”Art Warren got five outs for his third save. Albert Almora Jr. added an RBI double in the ninth for Cincinnati. Later in the inning, a bases-loaded catcher’s interference call on Joey Bart allowed Nick Senzel to reach, forcing in the Reds’ fifth run. Reds first baseman Joey Votto was given a day off after seven straight starts since an 18-day layoff with COVID-19. Mike Moustakas started at first base. “It is awesome to get that first W,” Ashcraft said. “It is something I’ve been working on for a long time. I’m extremely pleased. Strikeouts are great and every thing but a lot of ground balls can keep you in the game longer.”TRAINERS ROOMGiants: C Curt Casali is expected to come off the 7-day concussion list Saturday. ... 1B Brandon Belt (right knee inflammation) is eligible to come off the 10-day IL on Sunday but will need a few more days. Reds: LHP Mike Minor threw six innings in a minor league rehab start and remains on track to rejoin the rotation next week. He’s been on the IL all season with a left shoulder strain.

(AP) — Ejgayehu Taye of Ethiopia bested world record holder Letesenbet Gidey in the 5,000 meters at the Prefontaine Classic on Friday night. Taye surged on the final lap to win in a meet record and personal best 14 minutes, 12.98 seconds, ahead of fellow Ethiopian Gidney in 14:24.59. Taye’s time was the best ever on American soil and fifth-best ever. Olympic gold medalist and world record holder Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda won the men’s 5,000 in 12:57.99. There were a pair of races that were not associated with the Diamond League meet. The men’s and women’s 10,000-meter races were U.S. Track and Field qualification events for the world outdoor championships set for July at Hayward Field. Karissa Schweizer, who had Achilles surgery in October and just returned to competition last month, won the women’s event in 30:49.56 seconds. Alicia Monson was runner-up with Natosha Rogers finishing third. All three earn a spot on the U.S. team for worlds. Joe Klecker won the men’s 10K in 28:28.71, followed by Grant Fischer and Sean McGorty. Emmanuel Bor fell down the stretch and finished eighth. The National Weather Service forecast called for rain with wind gusts and the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms on Saturday, prompting organizers to move some of the field events. Ukranian Yaroslava Mahuchikh won the women’s high jump with a leap of 6 feet, 6.75 inches. Armand Duplantis of Sweden cleared 19-4.75 to win the men’s pole vault. Valarie Allman won the discus with a throw of 224-3. Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi fell just short of a world record in the women’s 2-mile race. Niyonsaba finished in a meet record 8:59.08, a half a second off of Meseret Defar’s world best. Caster Semenya was set to run in the women’s 2-mile race, but withdrew. Semenya is banned from competing in distances from 400-meters to the mile at top-level track meets in updated testosterone regulations unless she agrees to again take medication to lower her testosterone. She has refused, and hasn’t run an 800-meter race at a major meet since 2019. "
"2","Mariners hammer Verlander for 4 HRs in 6-1 win over Astros","e30e0f0ec8fdddd193ce1db36f268dbc","/article/mlb-sports-houston-astros-seattle-e30e0f0ec8fdddd193ce1db36f268dbc","SEATTLE (AP) — After being shut down by Justin Verlander twice already this season, the approach by the Seattle Mariners this time around was to be overly aggressive. “I said it to the club before the game, ‘If it looks like you can hit it hard, swing at it. Take our chances,’” Seattle manager Scott Servais said. “And that’s what we did tonight.”Rookie Julio Rodríguez hit the first of Seattle’s four home runs off Houston’s ace, and the Mariners thumped the Astros 6-1 on Friday night. Rodríguez, Kyle Lewis, Ty France and Taylor Trammell went deep off Verlander, tying his career-high for homers allowed in a start. Verlander (6-2) entered with seven earned runs allowed in 51 2/3 innings this season and gave up six to the Mariners, all via the long ball. “I think I made a lot of really hittable pitches and just needed to execute a little bit better,” Verlander said. Rodríguez got the Mariners started with a two-run opposite field homer in the first inning on the first pitch he saw from Verlander. Four batters later, Lewis unloaded with his first of the season, also a two-run homer. Lewis’ long ball was estimated at 441 feet and was his first since May 28 last year before suffering a knee injury that required surgery and forced the 2020 AL Rookie of the Year to miss the rest of the season. “We’ve faced him enough times to know that runs are hard to come by,” Lewis said. “So just trying to be aggressive as possible. That’s one thing we preached in the pregame and try to really go out and execute. It’s actually a good job of seeing the pregame transition into the game.”France added a solo homer run in the third, his seventh of the season, and Trammell barely cleared the fence in right-center field in the sixth inning. Seattle’s 10 hits were the most allowed by Verlander since April 15, 2017, when he still pitched for Detroit. The six earned runs were the most allowed since 2018 when Verlander also gave up six runs to the Mariners. Verlander started the night with a scoreless streak at 19 innings — one off his career-best — and a major league-leading 1.22 ERA. The scoreless streak ended after three batters, and his ERA ended the night at 2.03. “They had a good game plan. Kind of kept me off balance all night. Was never able to get into a good rhythm,” Verlander said. “I had one kind of quick inning, but other than that it was a bit of a struggle.” On the other side, Seattle’s Chris Flexen tossed a gem, rebounding from three consecutive shaky outings. Flexen (2-6) allowed one run and seven hits over seven innings with six strikeouts. Flexen has allowed five earned runs in 18 innings over three starts against Houston this season. “I just tried to flip the script. Been struggling lately and tried to get back to how it was last year,” Flexen said. “Be a better competitor and get back to execution for me and was able to do that tonight.”Houston’s lone run came on Jose Siri’s fielder’s choice in the second inning. Houston was held to three runs or less for the seventh time in the past 11 games. HOMER HAPPENINGSVerlander allowed four homers in a game twice while pitching for Detroit — both against Cleveland in 2006 and 2016 — and once with the Astros against the Tigers on July 15, 2018. ROSTER MOVESSeattle selected the contract of LHP Roenis Elías from Triple-A Tacoma and designated RHP Riley O’Brien for assignment. Seattle had an open roster spot after optioning struggling reliever Drew Steckenrider to Tacoma on Thursday. Steckenrider was one of Seattle’s top relievers a year ago but is 0-2 with a 5.65 ERA. It’s the second stint this season for Elías with the Mariners. TRAINER’S ROOMMariners: RHP Ken Giles (finger) is expected to soon start a rehab assignment with a mix of Tacoma and Class-A Everett. ... RHP Erik Swanson (elbow) could throw off a mound before the end of the weekend and be sent out on a rehab assignment next week. ... INF Abraham Toro (shoulder) should be ready ot come off the 10-day IL when eligible next week. UP NEXTAstros: RHP José Urquidy (4-1, 2.94) is coming off his best start of the season throwing 6 2/3 innings allowing one run and striking out 10 in a victory over Texas. Mariners: RHP Logan Gilbert (4-2, 2.60) looks to throw at least seven innings for a third straight start.

It came a day after they scored three runs in their final at-bat in a 4-1 victory.“We’re starting to kind of put things together and we’re starting to feel more confidence, not only here in the clubhouse but out on the field,” Ibañez said through an interpreter. “It’s a really good vibe.”Kole Calhoun drew a walk from Jiménez (1-2) to open the ninth and took third on Nathaniel Lowe’s one-out single. After Brad Miller stuck out looking and stood at home plate yelling at umpire Phil Cuzzi, Ibañez bounced a 1-2 pitch up into center field and then scored on Marcus Semien’s single.Ibañez’s hit came after a quick conversation with teammate Adolis García.“(We) were sitting in the dugout talking about how to stay positive, that things don’t always come out the way they’re supposed to, but to be positive,” Ibañez said. “That helped me out a lot, gave me a lot of confidence.”Sean Murphy and Chad Pinder hit back-to-back home runs off Jon Gray for the A’s during a five-run third. Trailing 5-2, the Rangers scored twice in the seventh then tied it in the eighth on Adolis García’s RBI double off Zach Jackson. García delivered the tie-breaking hit in Thursday’s 4-1 win.Matt Moore (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings and had three strikeouts. Dennis Santana worked the ninth for his first save since the Dominican Rookie League in 2014.“Instead of panicking, it was one at-bat after another,” Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. “You hope to win every game 7-2 or 7-0, but when you find yourself tied in back-to-back games in the ninth inning, yesterday against a good pitcher and today against their closer, and you find a way to score three, that gives us a ton of confidence.”The Rangers have allowed five runs or fewer in 12 consecutive games, the longest active streak in the majors and longest by Texas since 2017.Gray was tagged for a season-high five runs and five hits in six innings. A’s starter Cole Irvin allowed two runs — one earned — in the first before settling in. The left-hander retired the side in order four times and had four strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings.KOTSAY WATCHA’s manager Mark Kotsay will miss Saturday’s game to attend his daughter Grace’s high school graduation in San Diego. “It’s an exciting day for our family,” said Kotsay, adding that his daughter received a full scholarship to attend USC’s Marshall School of Business.

Polanco’s first inning two-run homer was his fifth of the season and it came in his first at-bat after missing three games with an ankle injury. Correa’s solo home run was his third of the season and broke a 4-4 tie in the fourth inning to give the Twins a lead they never relinquished. Every batter from both teams reached base at least once.“We’re going to hit some balls out of the ballpark, we know that,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “But if you can’t have those types of at-bats like we had today, getting some baserunners, forcing the action a little, making the other team uncomfortable ... you’re going to end up real hit or miss. You’re going to end up winning a few games with some big swings and you’re going to end up coming up short most of the time.”Bobby Witt Jr. finished a double shy of the cycle for the Royals, who have lost seven of eight. He singled in the first, hit a two-run triple in the third and added a solo homer in the seventh for his sixth of the season. In his bid to complete the cycle, he flew out to right field in the eighth inning with two runners on base.“Special, to have that kind of day,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said of Witt. “He showed a little bit of everything with the opposite field power, with obviously the way that he runs, almost saw one of the best defensive plays of the year. ... He really had a good night.”Minnesota starter Bailey Ober pitched three innings, allowing three runs on five hits and one walk while striking out five.

MJ Melendez also homered for the Royals, who fought back down four runs after the first inning. Witt’s triple scored a pair of runs and Hunter Dozier added an RBI single in the third inning. Nicky Lopez singled home a run to tie it in the fourth. Lopez finished 3 for 3 with a walk. The game didn’t remain tied for long. Correa’s home run and a sacrifice fly from Trevor Larnach in the bottom of the fourth gave the Twins a two-run lead that was cut to one with Witt’s home run. The Twins added four runs in the eighth inning on Gio Urshela’s second RBI single of the night, Nick Gordon’s two-run double and Luis Arraez’s RBI single. Gordon finished 2 for 4 with three RBIs.Melendez’s solo home run and Emmanuel Rivera’s RBI double cut the Royals’ deficit to three in the ninth. But Pagán came in and struck out Lopez to end the game. “I was happy with the way we fought in that game,” Baldelli said. “It was a game we could have lost. I know we ended up winning by a little bit, and put 10 on the board, or whatever it was. But that’s a game that could have easily gone in the wrong direction and there was a toughness level from our guys that was good tonight.”HE SAID THAT“He’s probably one of the better players I’ve ever seen, just how explosive he is. And he’s a great kid, too, on top of that. You hate to see those guys that are uber athletes and they’re not good people. He’s as good as it comes and it’s easy to root for people like that.” — Lopez on Witt.COVID UPDATEThe Twins placed OF Gilberto Celestino on the COVID-19 Injured List on Friday. He is experiencing “mild symptoms,” Baldelli said. Celestino has played in 31 games for the Twins this season, hitting .324 (24-for-74) with four doubles, four RBIs, 10 runs scored, seven walks and a .398 on-base percentage.TRAINER’S ROOMRoyals: Matheny said C Salvador Perez is now “day-to-day” with a left thumb strain after his stint on the 10-day IL ended Friday. Perez joined the Royals in Minneapolis on Thursday and has participated in both batting and catching drills. Perez injured the thumb while batting on May 17 against the Chicago White Sox. Twins: LHP Danny Coulombe returned from his rehab assignment and was reinstated from the 15-day IL on Friday. He took Celestino’s spot on the 26-man roster. Coulombe missed the Twins’ last 15 games with left hip impingement, and appeared in two games on rehab assignment with Triple-A St. Paul. Coulombe faced five batters in relief Friday and allowed one run on two hits and two walks. He retired one batter.

"2","O’s erase 6-run deficit vs Red Sox bullpen, win 12-8","e6aae1e983a9c0dcdd4cdc555962b76d","/article/mlb-sports-travel-baseball-boston-e6aae1e983a9c0dcdd4cdc555962b76d","BOSTON (AP) — Anthony Santander hit a tiebreaking single in the ninth inning and also had a two-run homer, helping the Baltimore Orioles overcome a pair of six-run deficits to beat the Boston Red Sox 12-8 Friday night. Baltimore trailed 8-2 before Jorge Mateo hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning and Austin Hays added a two-run shot in the eighth. The Orioles also capitalized on a throwing error by third baseman Rafael Devers for the tying run in the eighth.“We’re just not giving at-bats away. When their pitchers are leaving stuff over the heart of the plate, we’re not missing it,” Hays said. “When they’re trying to get us to chase and they’re chasing strikeouts, we’re not chasing those pitches.”The Orioles have won 20 games this season and Friday’s was the 11th comeback. Hays said the young lineup doesn’t lack for confidence, and it showed as the Orioles rallied against a team that has been rolling through May and had scored 33 runs over its previous three games. “We could be down 30-0 and we’re still staying positive, still staying in it,” Santander said through a translator. Santander’s single against Matt Strahm (2-2) dropped just in front of sliding right fielder Jackie Bradley Jr., allowing Cedric Mullins to score. Mullins led off the inning with a single, then took third on Trey Mancini’s single with a slick slide around Devers’ attempted tag.The Orioles piled on three more runs in the ninth, and Jorge Lopez didn’t allow a runner in the bottom half. Baltimore’s bullpen limited Boston to one hit after the fifth inning.Boston fans booed as the Orioles celebrated. Baltimore outhit the Red Sox 15-14 to open the five-game series.“These guys are grinders out there,” said Baltimore starter Kyle Bradish, who lasted just 1 2/3 innings and left trailing 6-0. “We’re showing that we can hang with the best of them. I put us in a hole early and the bullpen picked me up, and then the bats came alive later in the game. ”Santander also hit a two-run homer in the fourth, Baltimore’s first hit of the night. Santander’s eighth homer of the season accounted for the only runs allowed by Garrett Whitlock, who delivered six strong innings before Boston’s bullpen unraveled. Cionel Perez (3-0) got the win with one pitch, a popup by Christian Arroyo that ended the eighth inning.Xander Bogaerts hit a three-run homer during a four-run first inning for Boston, and the Red Sox scored two more in the second. Trevor Story, who entered Friday with seven homers and 21 RBIs in his previous seven games, was the only Boston batter without a hit Friday. Story did reach base in the eighth when reliever Dillon Tate hit him in the helmet as he tried to duck out of the way. J.D. Martinez and Bogaerts were also plunked by high fastballs, but neither appeared injured. WELCOME BACK PAPIFormer Red Sox slugger David Ortiz was back at Fenway Park for his first of two Hall of Fame inductions this summer. Ortiz headlined the Red Sox Hall of Fame class of 2020 in a ceremony that was delayed two years by the pandemic. Ortiz will be enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame in July. He was joined in the 2020 Red Sox class by former Boston catcher Rich Gedman, former general manager Dan Duquette, the late Bill Dinneen and Manny Ramirez, who was not at the ceremony. TRAINER’S ROOMOrioles: IF prospect Jahmai Jones had Tommy John surgery Friday, a procedure that ended this season for Jones and possibly a chunk of 2023, manager Brandon Hyde said. Jones was batting .212 with two homers for Triple-A Norfolk before going on the IL earlier this month with inflammation in his right elbow. Red Sox: LHP Chris Sale (rib stress fracture) threw three bullpen sessions this week and could throw a simulated game or batting practice as early as next week, manager Alex Cora said. Cora said Sale could possibly start a minor-league rehab assignment in early June. UP NEXTRHP Nathan Eovaldi (1-2, 4.10 ERA) is scheduled to start the opener for the Red Sox in a doubleheader Saturday. Hyde said he would likely go with RHP Jordan Lyles (3-4, 4.10) in the opener and come up with a spot starter to throw the first few innings in the nightcap. Boston planned to call-up RHP Josh Winckowski to start the evening game in his major league debut. ___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","Alonso homers, drives in 4 as Mets hold off Phillies 8-6","8e2ad9fe74b3ac4065aeeb00a4174ec3","/article/mlb-sports-new-york-baseball-8e2ad9fe74b3ac4065aeeb00a4174ec3","NEW YORK (AP) — The last time Pete Alonso approached the plate, he never got near the batter’s box. Phillies manager Joe Girardi quickly held up four fingers for an intentional walk.By then, it was too late.Alonso homered, doubled and drove in four runs, taking over the major league RBIs lead and powering the New York Mets past Philadelphia 8-6 Friday night.“He’s always a pitch away,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said, adding, “he never stops pushing.”Alonso has 45 RBIs this season and has especially battered the Phillies, with five home runs and 17 RBIs in 10 games against them.The slugger tied the team record of 28 RBIs in the month of May set by Willie Montañez in 1978. Alonso gets four more games to match the Mets record for RBIs in any month, set by Hall of Famer Gary Carter with 34 in September 1985.Alonso’s RBI are the most by Mets player before Memorial Day, topping Bernard Gilkey’s 44 in 1996.“I’m just trying to capitalize on opportunities and just be as consistent as I can every day,” he said.Alonso had a sacrifice fly in a three-run first, a two-run homer — his 12th — in the third and an RBI double in the fourth.“We have just such a gritty approach. We’re not letting pitchers get away with mistakes and we’re just playing really good team ball right now,” he said.Alonso also made a nifty diving stop at first to prevent Philadelphia from scoring early, one of six grounders he fielded for outs. And he caught pinch-hitter J.T. Realmuto’s foul popup to end the eighth with runners on second and third.Down 7-0 to Carlos Carrasco, the Phillies made it close by scoring six times in the sixth inning, capped by Garrett Stubbs’ three-run homer.Mets relievers Drew Smith, Joely Rodríguez, Seth Lugo and Edwin Díaz held on, helping the NL East leaders beat Philadelphia for the seventh time in 10 games this season. Díaz got his 11th save in 14 chances.Shut out by Carrasco (5-1) on two hits going into the sixth, Philadelphia rallied. Infield hits by Rhys Hoskins and Alec Bohm set up RBI singles by Bryce Harper and Nick Castellanos.A run-scoring grounder by Jean Segura and a two-out walk to Odúbel Herrera brought on lefty Chasen Shreve, and the lefty-hitting Stubbs lined a drive into the right-field seats.Showalter said Carrasco jammed his thumb fielding a ball in the inning, but didn’t expect it to be a problem.“We took advantage of some, you know, light hits — if you want to call it — and we made it work into six runs. Stubbs has a huge three-run homer and all of a sudden, we’re back in the game,” Girardi said. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to score after that.”The Mets added a run in the bottom half on Starling Marte’s RBI grounder.With storms all around Citi Field, the Phillies brought back Bailey Falter (0-2) from Triple-A to make the start. On his first pitch, Brandon Nimmo hit a routine grounder to rookie shortstop Bryson Stott, who threw it away for an error.“I know everybody in here is putting in the work, it’s just not paying off,” Castellanos said.THAT’S ENOUGHThe Phillies and Mets have a recent history of dustups over batters being hit by pitches, and they’ve already have had a couple of tense moments this season. After Segura was hit in the left hand by Carrasco in the top of the second, J.D. Davis nailed in the elbow by Falter’s first pitch in the bottom half. There were no more plunkings.MOVESPhillies: Struggling LHP José Alvarado was sent to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. The 27-year-old Alvarado was 0-1 with a 7.62 ERA in 17 games. Lefties were batting .333 against him.Mets: Right-handed reliever Yoan López had his three-game suspension cut to one game and served the penalty. He was recalled from Triple-A Syracuse before the game and sat out. MLB ruled that he intentionally threw at Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber on May 1.TRAINER’S ROOMPhillies: SS Didi Gregorius (sprained knee) walked on the field before the game. He’ll need a rehab stint before returning, Girardi said.Mets: OF Travis Jankowski is expected to miss 6-8 weeks because of a broken left hand. He had surgery and a screw was inserted. Showalter said Jankowski appeared to get hurt while making a diving catch. ... RHP Jacob deGrom (shoulder) threw on flat ground before the game. He will travel with the team when it begins a road trip to the West Coast in early June. The two-time Cy Young Award winner hasn’t pitched this season.UP NEXTPhillies: RHP Zach Eflin (1-3, 3.65 ERA) starts Saturday night. He is 3-5 with a 5.03 ERA in 14 career starts against the Mets.Mets: RHP Taijuan Walker (2-0, 2.70) is trying for his first home win since last June 15.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

No. 5 seed Arizona (37-22) plays Stanford in Saturday’s semifinals. The Wildcats have to beat the top-seeded Cardinal twice to advance to Sunday’s championship game. With the temperature in Arizona breaking into triple-digits, Bingham came up with two out and the bases loaded and hit a line-drive over the head of center fielder Joe Lampe to give Arizona an 8-6 lead. Chase Davis and Tony Bullard drew back-to-back walks, Garen Caulfield’s sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third and Noah Turley was intentionally walked.Daniel Susac hit a three-run home run, Tanner O’Tremba followed two pitches later with a solo shot and Davis scored on a sacrifice fly by Garen Caulfield to give Arizona a 5-2 lead in the bottom of the third. Ryan Campos had a two-RBI single in the top of the first and his double to right-center in the seventh gave Arizona State (26-32) a 6-5 lead.

(AP) — Ross Chastain, who led for just four laps, got an assist from Grant Enfinger on the final lap to win the North Carolina Education Lottery 200 in double overtime on Friday night at Charlotte Motor Speedway for his fourth career NASCAR Trucks Series victory. Chastain, Christian Eckes and John Hunter Nemechek were running about even up high, in the middle and down low, respectively, before Eckes fell back as Enfinger came up on the outside and gave Chastain — whose truck appeared somewhat unstable down the stretch — a push into the lead, which he held down the stretch to take the checkered flag. “I hate it so much for Carson,” said Chastain, Hocevar’s teammate with Niece Motorsport. “I didn’t give him the push he needed to win (on the first attempt at overtime)… Man, I’m so proud of Carson Hocevar. “I’ll say that over and over. That guy’s a future star. He’s such a goofy kid, but I love him. He learns so quick.”Enfinger finished second, Nemechek third, Eckes came in fourth and Zane Smith, who won Stage 1, was fifth. Ben Rhodes won Stage 2. Carson Hocevar won 57 of the 143 laps but wrecked after touching trucks with Ryan Preece while racing for the lead in the first overtime and finished 16th. Preece came in 16th after pitting with a flat tire. “A dumbass move by myself,” acknowledged the 19-year-old Hocevar.Chastain was the leader on the last restart but lost the lead to Eckes and then Nemechek before Enfinger’s assist. “I’m glad to push my buddy Ross to a win,” Enfinger said. “In my book, he owes me one.”___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

The sellout crowd of 40,064 at Truist Park was still celebrating Acuña’s hit as Bass walked Dansby Swanson.Albies then hit a blooper that fell into shallow left field. As Marlins left fielder Jorge Soler held the ball too long, Acuña easily scored the go-ahead run and Swanson ran through third-base coach Ron Washington’s stop sign to also score.“I just had an instinct,” Swanson said. “For a split second, I felt like his attention went to Ozzie or his eyes moved. It was something as I was running to third that I processed that he was like on his second read.”Soler threw the ball to Joey Wendle at third base instead of to the plate.“It looked like he had a little bit of hesitation,” Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Soler. “I know Dansby ran through the stop sign. ... I don’t know if he saw it, too.”Acuña said he wasn’t surprised Swanson scored.“That’s our style of play,” Acuña said. “We are always going to play hard. If a team is caught sleeping a little bit, we’re going to take advantage of that situation.”Jackson Stephens (1-1) had two strikeouts and allowed no hits in two scoreless innings behind Ian Anderson. Braves manager Brian Snitker called the comeback “huge” as the defending World Series champions (22-24) “are trying to get going.”“Those kind of wins can just be so good for a club’s psyche,” Snitker said.Kenley Jansen gave up a one-out single to Brian Anderson in the ninth before recovering for his 11th save in 13 chances. Jansen struck out Jacob Stallings and Jesús Sánchez, each on called third strikes, to end the game.Bass allowed two runs while recording two outs.Jesús Aguilar hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the sixth inning as Miami took a 4-3 lead after trailing 3-0.Garrett Cooper also hit a two-run homer in the Marlins’ four-run sixth off Anderson. It was a quick answer by the Marlins following Atlanta’s three-run fifth against Trevor Rogers, who was perfect through four innings.Austin Riley’s fifth-inning homer produced the game’s first run — and Atlanta’s first hit. Travis d’Arnaud followed Riley’s homer with a double off the glove of shortstop Miguel Rojas into left field. With one out, William Contreras drove in d’Arnaud with a double to the wall in center field.IMPROVEMENT FOR ROGERSRogers allowed three runs on four hits and one walk in five innings. It was an improvement from his last start when he gave up five runs on eight hits in four innings in a 5-3 loss to the Braves on May 20.“He was a lot better today,” Mattingly said.LONG DROUGHT ENDSTravis Demeritte snapped an 0-for-34 slump with a run-scoring single to left field that drove in Contreras in the fifth for a 3-0 lead. Following his first hit since May 14, a grateful Demeritte placed his hands together in a prayerful pose as he stood and smiled at first base.TRAINER’S ROOMMarlins: IF Jon Berti returned from the COVID-19 injured list, while OF Avisaíl García was placed on the list. ...
