"1","Afghanistan: UK's withdrawal a disaster, inquiry concludes","The UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan last year was a ""disaster"" and a ""betrayal"" that will damage the nation's interests for years, an inquiry by MPs has found.The Foreign Affairs Committee said there had been ""systemic failures"" of intelligence, diplomacy and planning.Chairman Tom Tugendhat said there had been a failure to lead ""at a time when lives were quite literally being lost"".The UK government said ""intensive planning"" went into the withdrawal.A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) defended its handling of the withdrawal and said it would review and respond to the committee's findings.The cross-party MPs who carried out the inquiry said ""mismanagement"" of the evacuation as the Taliban quickly took over the country ""likely cost lives"".They added they had lost confidence in the department's top civil servant, Sir Philip Barton, and urged him to consider his position.The report said the fact Sir Philip, the then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were all on leave when the Taliban took Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, ""marks a fundamental lack of seriousness, grip or leadership at a time of national emergency"".Mr Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's a very clear criticism of the failure to plan, the failure to prepare, and the failure to lead at a moment of extraordinary national emergency, at a time when lives were quite literally being lost, at a time when every decision was fraught with risk, and highly contentious, and needed to be made very quickly by people who had the authority to do so.""The ""fundamental failure"" was one of leadership, the Conservative MP added.Labour shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the report ""highlights the scale of the government's incompetence, laziness and mishandling"" of the withdrawal.""The Conservative government has badly let down Britain's reputation on the global stage and those responsible for this calamity should be held accountable,"" he said.The PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson retained full confidence in Sir Philip.Asked why he remained the right person to head the FCDO, the spokesman said: ""He has significant experience in that field and a number of changes have already been made.""The spokesman also said Mr Johnson did not regret making Mr Raab deputy prime minister after the evacuation.A coalition of international forces - led by the US - completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan on 30 August 2021, marking the end of the 20-year campaign in the country.US-led forces went into Afghanistan in 2001, removing the Taliban from power in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on al-Qaeda - a militant jihadist group.The UK sent forces but ended its combat operations in 2014, leaving hundreds of troops to help train the Afghan government's army.In February 2020, a withdrawal deal was signed by the Taliban and the US under former President Donald Trump and a year later his successor, Joe Biden, honoured the agreement.As the US pulled out troops and reduced military support for the Afghan army, the Taliban made rapid territorial gains, reclaiming control of the whole country by mid-August.The report brings back the sense of horror and, for some, shame generated by last August's traumatic evacuation from Kabul.It was always inevitable that ministers and senior officials were going to be lambasted. During the committee's hearings, MPs expressed their dismay that the Foreign Office's top civil servant hadn't seen fit to return from holiday until the civilian evacuation was over.And it was clear that they found some of the answers they received evasive and unconvincing.Some will argue that the speed of the Taliban's takeover of the country could not have been anticipated and made planning for such a complex evacuation impossible without causing widespread panic.It's not an argument that cuts much ice with the MPs. They say there was plenty of time to make plans and that what happened was a betrayal that will haunt the UK's international reputation for years.In September 2021, the committee launched an inquiry to consider the role of the FCDO in the build-up to, during and after the withdrawal.The committee published its findings on Tuesday in a report, which ""identified systemic failures of intelligence, diplomacy, planning and preparation - many of which were due, at least in part, to the Foreign Office"".In key findings, the report said:On planning for withdrawalOn the evacuationOn the future relationship with AfghanistanAmy Richards, director of the charity Global Witness, said no-one who was involved in the withdrawal would be the surprised ""chaos, confusion and a total lack of leadership"" described in the report.However, she said it failed to address a ""continued failure"" of the UK to meet its responsibilities, arguing government refugee schemes ""have barely got off the ground"".""As life gets harder for those in Afghanistan, Britain is further pulling up the drawbridge and letting down those who carried out brave acts of solidarity on our behalf over many years. We should be utterly ashamed by this,"" Ms Richards said.The UK airlifted about 15,000 Afghans and British nationals out of Kabul as the Taliban took control of the country. Thousands of staff from across the UK government and partners supported the evacuation effort.An FCDO spokesperson said: ""This was the biggest UK mission of its kind in generations and followed months of intensive planning and collaboration between UK government departments,"" ""We are still working hard to assist the people of Afghanistan, having already helped over 4,600 individuals to leave the country since the end of the military evacuation.""We carried out a thorough review to learn lessons from our withdrawal from Afghanistan and have drawn on many of the findings in our response to the conflict in Ukraine including introducing new systems for managing correspondence and increasing senior oversight of our operational and diplomatic response."""

"1","Israel says Hamas plot to kill prominent politician in Jerusalem thwarted","A court in Israel has charged three Palestinians with planning to kill an Israeli politician, kidnap soldiers and bomb Jerusalem's light railway.The men belong to the militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip.Israel's internal security agency, which arrested the men, also found an explosive drone which they allegedly planned to use to attack the railway.  Israeli leaders have repeatedly accused Hamas of fomenting violence in Jerusalem. Israeli-Palestinian tensions in the city have soared in recent weeks, following clashes in and around a flashpoint holy site, attacks on Israelis by Palestinian assailants, and violent tactics by Israeli police against Palestinians at the funeral of Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Sherine Abu Aqla.The three Palestinians belonged to a five-man cell, all of whom come from occupied East Jerusalem and were arrested in April.Those charged are accused of planning to assassinate the far-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir and to attack other Israeli targets. They are also accused of planning to kidnap Israeli soldiers to use as bargaining chips for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The Shin Bet internal security agency found a camera which it says was intended to be used to film hostages.Shin Bet says the cell was led by a prominent Hamas operative who is alleged to have set up a network of supporters to stir up recent unrest in the Old City. Hamas flags were waved in the compound of a holy site revered by Jews and Muslims, which was the scene of repeated clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police over the past two months. The five men were involved in rioting in East Jerusalem and in the compound, Shin Bet says.The site, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), contains the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is the third holiest place in Islam. It is also known to Jews as the Temple Mount and is the holiest site in Judaism.Hamas does not recognise Israel's right to exist and has carried out thousands of attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers in recent years. Israel regards it as a terrorist group and, along with Egypt, has blockaded Gaza since 2007 as a security measure. Militants in Gaza have also fought four major conflicts with Israel since then.Mr Ben Gvir thanked the security services for arresting the ""squad of terrorists"", but he also blamed ""the incitement of the leftists against me"" for helping make him a target."
"1","Mexico shooting: Gunmen open fire at hotel in Celaya","Gunmen have opened fire at a hotel in the Mexican city of Celaya, in central Guanajuato state. Local media say at least 11 people have been killed and several more injured. Witnesses said a group of around 15 armed men stormed into the hotel at 22:00 local time (03:00 GMT) shooting and throwing petrol bombs before also attacking at least two nearby bars.The security forces are at the scene but have not yet issued a statement as to who may be behind the shooting. The city of Celaya has seen a spike in violence with a criminal cartel calling itself Santa Rosa de Lima involved in a deadly feud with its rivals, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.The Santa Rosa cartel mainly engages in extortion and fuel theft. Its former leader, José Yépez, was sentenced to 60 years in prison earlier this year.While his capture in 2020 was hailed as a major blow to the cartel, the battle to succeed him has unleashed further violence."
"1","Who are the Uyghurs and why is China being accused of genocide?","China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang.Human rights groups believe China has detained more than one million Uyghurs against their will over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", and sentenced hundreds of thousands to prison terms.A series of police files obtained by the BBC in 2022 has revealed details of China's use of these camps and described the routine use of armed officers and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape.The US is among several countries to have previously accused China of committing genocide in Xinjiang. The leading human rights groups Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have published reports accusing China of crimes against humanity.China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government - speaking after details of the Xinjiang Police Files were published - said the peace and prosperity brought to Xinjiang as a result of its anti-terrorism measures were the best response to ""all sorts of lies"".There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.Uyghur activists say they fear that the group's culture is under threat of erasure.More on this storyXinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's largest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both regions are subjected to major restrictions by the central government.Xinjiang is a mostly desert region and produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. Human rights groups have voiced concerns that much of that cotton export is picked by forced labour, and in 2021 some Western brands removed Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, leading to a backlash against the brands from Chinese celebrities and netizens.In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang. There is evidence that new factories have been built within the grounds of the re-education camps.  The region is also rich in oil and natural gas and because of its proximity to Central Asia and Europe is seen by Beijing as an important trade link.In the early 20th Century, the Uyghurs briefly declared independence for the region but it was brought under the complete control of China's new Communist government in 1949.Several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing genocide - defined by international convention as the ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"".The declarations follow reports that, as well as interning Uyghurs in camps, China has been forcibly mass sterilising Uyghur women to suppress the population, separating children from their families, and attempting to break the cultural traditions of the group.The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said China is committing ""genocide and crimes against humanity"".The UK parliament declared in April 2021 that China was committing a genocide in Xinjiang.A UN human rights committee in 2018 said it had credible reports that China was holding up to a million people in ""counter-extremism centres"" in Xinjiang.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute found evidence in 2020 of more than 380 of these ""re-education camps"" in Xinjiang, an increase of 40% on previous estimates.Analysis of data contained in the latest police documents, called the Xinjiang Police Files, showed that almost 23,000 residents - or more than 12% of the adult population of one county - were in a camp or prison in the years 2017 and 2018. If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, the figures would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults.The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the files contained ""shocking details of China's human rights violations"".Earlier, leaked documents known as the China Cables made clear that the camps were intended to be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline and punishments.People who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse.Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in Xinjiang from the 1990s, sometimes flaring into violence. In 2009 about 200 people died in clashes in Xinjiang, which the Chinese blamed on Uyghurs who wanted their own state. But in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent.Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. According to Human Rights Watch, police are also using a mobile app to monitor people's behaviour, such as how much electricity they are using and how often they use their front door. Since 2017, when President Xi Jinping issued an order saying all religions in China should be Chinese in orientation, there have been further crackdowns. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate Uyghur culture.The Xinjiang Police Files, which all date from before 2019, shed further light on Uyghurs being punished for alleged crimes that took place years ago. Many appear to have been targeted for their mobile phone use, for listening to ""illegal lectures"" or not using their phones enough, which is regarded as a sign the user is trying to evade digital surveillance. China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In response to the Xinjiang Police Files, China's foreign ministry spokesman told the BBC that the documents were ""the latest example of anti-China voices trying to smear China"". He said Xinjiang enjoyed stability and prosperity and residents were living happy, fulfilled lives.China says the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism.  It insists that Uyghur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uyghurs.China has dismissed claims it is trying to reduce the Uyghur population through mass sterilisations as ""baseless"", and says allegations of forced labour are ""completely fabricated"".

"1","Ukraine war: World faces 'dark hour', Biden tells Quad Summit","The world is ""navigating a dark hour in our shared history"" with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, US President Joe Biden told key Asian allies.The war has now become a ""global issue"" underscoring the importance of defending international order, he said.Japanese PM Fumio Kishida also echoed his comments, saying that a similar invasion should not happen in Asia. Mr Biden is meeting the leaders of Japan, Australia and India in Tokyo in his first visit to Asia as president.The four countries known collectively as the Quad are discussing security and economic concerns including China's growing influence in the region - and differences over the Russian invasion.Mr Biden's comments come a day after he warned China that it was ""flirting with danger"" over Taiwan, and vowed to protect Taiwan militarily if China attacked, appearing to contradict a long-standing US policy on the issue.In his opening remarks at Tuesday's summit, Mr Biden said their meeting was about ""democracies versus autocracies, and we have to make sure that we deliver"".The Ukraine war, he said, ""is going to affect all parts of the world"" as Russia's blockade of Ukraine grain exports aggravates a global food crisis.Mr Biden promised the US would work with allies to lead the global response, reiterating their commitment to defend international order and sovereignty ""regardless of where they were violated in the world"" and remaining a ""strong and enduring partner"" in the Indo-Pacific region.After their meeting, Mr Kishida told reporters that all four countries ""including India"" agreed on the importance of the rule of law, sovereignty and territorial integrity; and that ""unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force will never be tolerated"".India is the only Quad member so far that has refused to directly criticise Russia for the invasion. The Quad nations announced a new maritime monitoring initiative that is expected to step up surveillance of Chinese activity in the region, along with a plan to spend at least $50bn (£40bn) on infrastructure projects and investment over the next five years.Formally referred to as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose grouping of countries following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that banded together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance. The group fell dormant before it was resuscitated in 2017.Since then however, the top leaders have gathered for the fourth time - they have already met once in Washington last September and twice virtually - in less than two years. Analysts say the steady decline in each Quad nation's bilateral ties with China in the past few years appears to have given the grouping more impetus.There has been mounting discomfort with China's growing assertiveness in the region, with ongoing maritime disputes between China and several countries, and a land boundary conflict with India.Beijing's heavy investment in strengthening its navy and its recent security pact with the Solomon Islands has stoked fears in Australia, while Japan has become increasingly wary of what it calls routine ""incursions"" from the Chinese navy in its waters.On Monday Mr Biden unveiled the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a US-led trade pact aiming to promote regional growth that includes 13 countries, mostly in Asia. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said it would provide countries ""an alternative to China's approach"". Officials said it would set standards in the areas of trade, supply chains, clean energy and infrastructure, and tax and anti-corruption.The IPEF has been widely seen as a way for the US to re-engage with the Indo-Pacific after former US President Donald Trump's abrupt withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a regional trade pact - in 2017."
"1","Executions spiked in Iran in Saudi Arabia in 2021 - Amnesty","There was a worrying rise in executions in 2021 as Covid-19 restrictions were eased, Amnesty International says, with spikes seen in Iran and Saudi Arabia.A report by the human rights group says at least 579 executions were known to have been carried out in 18 countries - a 20% increase on the previous year.Iran accounted for the biggest portion of this rise. It put to death at least 314 people, compared with 246 in 2020.Saudi Arabia more than doubled its number of executions to 65.The global total is the second-lowest figure, after 2020, that Amnesty has recorded since at least 2010. However, as in previous years it does not include China. Although it is believed to execute thousands of people each year, the data on its use of the death penalty is a state secret. Amnesty says secrecy also made it impossible to verify reports from North Korea and Vietnam, where an extensive number of executions is thought to have taken place.Amnesty's annual death penalty report says Iran's highest known figure since 2017 was due in part to a more than five-fold increase in drug-related executions to 132, from 23 in 2020. The rights group calls this a ""flagrant violation of international law, which prohibits use of the death penalty for crimes other than those involving intentional killing"".The 140% rise in the number of executions in Saudi Arabia last year was, according to Amnesty, the start of a ""grim trend that continued in 2022 with the execution of 81 people in a single day in March"". Significant increases were also recorded in Somalia (21, up from 11 in 2021), South Sudan (9, up from 2) and Yemen (14, up from 5). The report says that the easing of Covid-related restrictions also led to judges handing down at least 2,052 death sentences in 56 countries - an almost 40% increase on 2020.It highlights an ""alarming"" rise in the use of the death penalty under martial law in Myanmar, where the military transferred the authority to try civilian cases to military tribunals.""Instead of building on the opportunities presented by hiatuses in 2020, a minority of states demonstrated a troubling enthusiasm to choose the death penalty over effective solutions to crime, showing a callous disregard for the right to life even amid urgent and ongoing global human rights crises,"" said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty's secretary general."
"1","Ukraine war: Russia's jailed Navalny attacks invasion as judge rejects appeal","Russia's prominent jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny has lost an appeal against a nine-year prison term, but not before launching a scathing attack on the war in Ukraine.Condemning Vladimir Putin's war as stupid, he said it was ""like your courts, built entirely on lies"".Navalny was already serving a jail term when he was convicted in a fraud case rejected by supporters as fabricated.He addressed the court in Moscow via a video link at his penal colony.Long seen as a President Putin's most vocal critic in Russia, Navalny was detained the moment he flew home from Germany after treatment for a near-fatal nerve agent attack in Siberia in August 2020.He was initially jailed for two and a half years for breaking bail conditions while being treated in hospital, but in March he was given an extra nine years for fraud and contempt of court.The prosecutor told the court the verdict in March had been fair and justified but Navalny's defence lawyer argued it had contradicted international law. In comments that were repeatedly interrupted, Navalny said he despised the court and said the rulings against him were no different from the lies used by ""madman"" President Putin and state TV to justify the war.""You will suffer a historic defeat in this stupid war that you started. It has no purpose or meaning. Why are we fighting a war?"" he said.Russia has silenced criticism of its three-month war in Ukraine, prosecuting dozens of people who have refused to use the term ""special military operation"" and blocking independent media outlets.During Tuesday's appeal hearing, Navalny told the court that the judge who gave him his initial jail term in February 2021, Natalya Repnikova, had later told his lawyers she regretted her decision. Repnikova died months later of coronavirus ""according to the official version"", he reportedly told the court.Since Navalny was jailed last year he has been held in a jail at Pokrov, east of Moscow, but he now faces being transferred to a penal colony with a far stricter regime and very limited rights to prison visits. His colleagues say he is due to be moved to a facility in Melekhovo, where one former prisoner has made allegations of systematic torture."
"1","Could hydrogen ease Germany's reliance on Russian gas?","The war in Ukraine has upended Germany's energy policy.Since the start of the war Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12% and on Russian gas from 55% to 35%.Nevertheless, energy trading is a huge source of revenue for Moscow. Over the first two months of the war Germany paid almost €9bn (£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas imports according to the Finnish thinktank CREA.Veronika Grimm is an economics professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and currently one of Germany's three special advisors to the federal government, called Economic Sages.""We need to diversify and decarbonise our energy sources faster than initially planned,"" she says. To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to ""ramp-up"" its use of hydrogen.Hydrogen can store vast amounts of energy, replace natural gas in industrial processes, and power fuel cells in trucks, trains, ships or planes that emit nothing but vapour of drinkable water.Ms Grimm's enthusiasm is gaining traction, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy research group, dozens of countries have published national hydrogen strategies, or are about to.Despite this flurry of interest, it's not clear yet that the large-scale use of hydrogen can be made viable.After all, there has been similar excitement before: in the 1970s, after two oil crises, and in the 1990s, when climate worries arose. But both petered out. So, is today's hype any different?The answer depends on whom you ask. Environmental groups are cautious, they point out that hydrogen cannot be harvested as a primary fuel. Firstly, it has to be made, mainly in two ways, each marked by a colour code.Green hydrogen is produced by using electricity from renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using an electrolyser. But those machines and the electricity to run them remain costly.These costs means that, at the moment, such emission-free hydrogen makes up only 0.03% of global hydrogen production, according to the IEA.Up to five times cheaper is so-called grey hydrogen, this is derived from natural gas, or in some cases from oil or coal. But due to losses during production, about 50% more CO2 is emitted than if natural gas were directly burned.A related technique is known as blue hydrogen. This relies on the same process, but captures about 60-90% of the carbon emitted in production for re-use or storage.The drawback with this method is that it roughly triples the cost and lacks production facilities at large scale. So it only 0.7% of globally-produced hydrogen is blue.So, despite its environmentally-friendly image and potential, the global production of hydrogen currently emits almost three times as much CO2 as a whole country, France, for instance.Much then will hinges on how countries decide to produce hydrogen.Some countries already have a clear priority - to power electrolysers most sun-baked nations bet on solar power, while France relies on nuclear energy.China meanwhile cherishes cheap grey hydrogen from coal and gas and invests in green alternatives.The US, Canada, UK, Netherlands and Norway are leading the push for blue hydrogen, by injecting captured carbon into oil and gas fields for long-term storage, or for so-called enhanced oil recovery that boosts extraction.In Germany, however, the picture is less clear. Volker Quaschning, professor for renewable energy systems at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences and criticises Germany's hydrogen strategy: ""Merkel's government used it as a red herring to conceal its own failures in the energy transition.""He argues that solar and wind power should have been expanded faster to facilitate future green hydrogen production - a step that Germany's new government has promised to take.However, on hydrogen the three parties in the governing coalition, the three responsible ministries, and the hydrogen council all internally argue whether to concentrate on green hydrogen, or to accept the blue alternative, to temporarily bridge the gap in limited supply. Ms Grimm represents the majority view on the hydrogen council in favouring a multi-colour mix.""Accepting blue hydrogen will help create the supply that we need for a budding industry,"" she argues. ""It will foster technological breakthroughs in Germany and encourage potential suppliers to invest in green hydrogen production.""In January, Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced an ambitious push for renewables and a doubling of the two-year old target for domestic production of green hydrogen to rise by a factor of 150 from 70 MW today to 10 GW by 2030. That target represents a quarter of the entire EU's aim of 40GW, and is larger than France's goal of 6.5 GW.So while this domestic production expands, Germany is looking to source hydrogen from abroad.Andreas Kuhlmann, head of the German Energy Agency, (a government-owned company facilitating the energy transition coordinating the Hydrogen Council), says Germany has dramatically sped-up international negotiations to buy hydrogen.That could include developing hydrogen pipelines to connect to southern Europe, where favourable conditions for solar and wind power allow the cost-efficient production of hydrogen. Mr Habeck is frantically visiting energy exporters. Within one week in March, he travelled to Norway to agree on a feasibility study for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline, went to Qatar to finalise an energy partnership and visited the United Arab Emirates to sign five cooperation agreements.The first deliveries from the UAE are expected to arrive later this year.Other countries on Mr Habeck's hydrogen radar are Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, Namibia and Australia.Though he acknowledges the need to import hydrogen, Mr Quaschning dashes some of Mr Habeck's hopes. ""Importing hydrogen from desert plants will be sluggish, inefficient and expensive,"" he explains.Each step in the supply chain uses up some of the original energy: desalinating sea water to get fresh water as raw material, electrolysis, liquification for shipping, transport via tanker, local transport via pipeline in Germany and re-conversion of hydrogen into electricity.""Together, these steps would eat up at least 70% of the electricity originally produced in the desert,"" Mr Quaschning says.""So, even though a solar panel in the desert produces 80% more electricity than one in Germany, the losses on the way are so big, that it would be twice as effective to directly produce solar power in Germany.""Due to its high-cost, hydrogen is often referred to as the champagne of the energy transition. So, who will get the first sips?On this, most observers agree. ""It is crucial that we allocate hydrogen only to those industries, where direct electrification is not possible"", explains Felix Matthes energy expert at Öko-Institut, a think tank, and member of Germany's hydrogen council.""So, we should first use it in the production of steel, chemicals and glass,"" he argues.Subsequent sectors could be shipping, long distance truck transport, as well as planes for medium or long distances. Other uses in cars or heating are inefficient, costly and impractical distractions, he adds.""Plus, Mr Habeck's new push for renewables will create a greater need to balance our electricity supply, which hydrogen could do with electrolysers producing hydrogen on sunny, windy days as large-scale storage for cloudy winter days,"" Mr Matthes says.The pressure is on Germany to stop spending so much on Russian energy, but it will be a tricky process.Many will be hoping that hydrogen eases that transition by fulfilling its promise this time around."
"1","Coronavirus: Argentine President Fernández pays 'fine' over lockdown party","Argentine President Alberto Fernández has made a large donation as part of a deal to end an investigation into a lockdown party he and his wife hosted.The couple came under investigation after photos emerged showing them having a birthday dinner attended by about a dozen people while lockdown measures were in force. At the time, public gatherings, including funerals, were banned.The photos caused outrage and caused the president's popularity to plummet.A judge agreed to the offer by the president and First Lady Fabiola Yáñez to donate three million pesos ($25,000; £20,000) in exchange for the case against them to be dropped.Prosecutors had stipulated that the amount donated should be the equivalent of a respiratory machine and a stay in intensive care in hospital.The money will go to a vaccine research institute. The scandal dubbed ""Olivosgate"" in reference to the president's official residence in Buenos Aires, where the dinner took place, broke in August 2021.Photos leaked to the press showed a smiling president and his wife with about 10 guests standing around a long table celebrating the First Lady's birthday.No one is wearing masks and the remnants of the dinner, including a cake, can still be seen on the table. It soon transpired that the photo had been taken in July 2020, when mandatory lockdown measures were in full force in the capital, Buenos Aires. Under the lockdown decree which the president himself had signed, group gatherings, including church services, were banned. Residents were told to leave their homes only ""for essential reasons"" and to keep at least 1.5m apart. Only those whose work was deemed essential were allowed to travel to their places of work and public transport was restricted.The leaked photo triggered an investigation into whether the president and his wife had breached health protocols.Originally, President Fernández, who is a professor of criminal law, had argued that there had been no breach because no one caught Covid as a result of the dinner party. But as public anger over the dinner party grew, he struck a more apologetic note, saying: ""I realise [the birthday dinner] shouldn't have happened, I'm sorry that it did, and it won't happen again.""Pollsters said that disenchantment with the president had contributed to his coalition's poor performance at the midterm elections in November 2021."

"1","Luc Besson: Rape case dismissed for French film director","The Paris Court of Appeal has dismissed a series of rape accusations against French film director Luc Besson. The director of The Big Blue and Nikita was accused by Dutch-Belgian actress Sand Van Roy in 2018 of repeatedly raping her over two years. Prosecutors dropped the case in early 2019, citing a lack of evidence, but re-opened inquiries later that year when Ms Van Roy made new allegations. Mr Besson's lawyer said the court had confirmed his client's innocence. ""About ten procedural initiatives by Ms Van Roy all ended in the same way. Luc Besson regrets these four lost years,"" Thierry Marembert added. Ms Van Roy's lawyer, Antoine Gitton, said the case had become a ""a sordid news item"" and announced his intention to appeal against the decision. The case was one of the highest-profile controversies of the #MeToo era in France, AFP news agency notes.Ms Van Roy had accused Mr Besson of raping her just hours after they met at a hotel in Paris in May 2018. But the original investigation ended when French prosecutors said there was not enough evidence to pursue a case.In December, an investigating magistrate issued a dismissal order against the case citing ""the absence of any material element to support the statements"" of Ms Van Roy and prosecutors asked for it to be dropped last month. At least three other women accused the 63-year-old of sexual misconduct during testimony heard in court. Mr Besson always denied these accusations. In 2019 he described the case against him as a ""lie from A to Z"".The director has previously described Ms Van Roy, who appeared in his films Taxi 5 and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, as a ""fantasist,"" though he did admit to having a sexual relationship with her. Mr Besson, a director, producer and screenwriter, is also known for his films Subway, Leon and The Fifth Element."

"4","Energy price cap: Typical energy bill set to rise £800 a year in October","A UK household's typical energy bill is set to rise by around £800 per year, the energy regulator has warned.Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to £2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices.The warning comes after a typical bill rose by an unprecedented £700 in April.Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"".The Ofgem boss also warned that the number of people in fuel poverty could double, with 12 million households set to fall into such circumstances if October's expected rise happens.A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. The energy price cap is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers. It has already risen sharply in April, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra £700 per year on average, but the more energy a household uses, the higher their bill will be.While Mr Brearley said that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of the next kit change due in October, he said: ""We are expecting a price cap in October in the region of £2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by £800 per year.Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns of potential supply issues.He warned that the price cap could rise beyond £2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies.""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia.""Europe is reliant on Russian gas and gets about 40% of its natural gas from the country, so sudden supply cuts could have huge economic impact.While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it is affected by prices rising in the global markets as demand in Europe increases.""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley said.But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices.We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious.Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying £700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of £800.The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is £3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice.So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead.In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"".The Prime Minister's official spokesman said some of the help from the government was ""phased throughout the year"".""Some of the support is designed to come in in October, £200 will be discounted from energy bills, the warm home discount will increase to £150 and be expanded to cover three million people, cold weather payments and winter fuel payments will be available again,"" he said.He added the government was also ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"".Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts?""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy.""Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households.Recently, Shell reported a record £7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made £5bn, the highest for 10 years."
"4","Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax to renewables","Energy firms are warning that an attempt to extend a windfall tax to renewable energy would threaten the government's entire energy strategy. Industry sources told the BBC it could destroy investor confidence ahead of key auctions for licences to develop new wind and solar projects. Shares in firms that could be affected fell sharply on Tuesday, with Centrica down 11% and SSE 9% lower. An announcement on windfall taxes could come as soon as Thursday.However, the Treasury said no decisions had yet been made. Sources close to the Treasury's thinking on how to impose a windfall tax point out that renewable and nuclear energy generators have also enjoyed windfall profits as electricity prices have also surged and they have enjoyed extra profits as they are not dependent on expensive gas to produce power.""Power producers whose costs haven't risen with the price of gas have enjoyed a windfall as well. It is logical and credible for them to be taxed on their excess profits as well,"" said one source. Energy experts also point out that there is no reason future investment in renewables should suffer, as they would be exempt from any windfall tax as projects are now auctioned with a fixed price for the power they ultimately produce and therefore it would be impossible for the companies to make excess profits if prices for electricity rise. Any windfall tax would be levied on older existing renewable income. However, the boss of one of the UK's biggest investors in renewables said his profits from renewable energy generation were in the low hundreds of millions for a whole year, compared to the £7bn made by Shell and the £5bn made by BP in the first three months of this year alone.""Going after renewables is total and utter nonsense,"" he said. "
"4","Could hydrogen ease Germany's reliance on Russian gas?","The war in Ukraine has upended Germany's energy policy.Since the start of the war Germany has reduced its dependence on Russian oil from 35% to 12% and on Russian gas from 55% to 35%.Nevertheless, energy trading is a huge source of revenue for Moscow. Over the first two months of the war Germany paid almost €9bn (£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas imports according to the Finnish thinktank CREA.Veronika Grimm is an economics professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, and currently one of Germany's three special advisors to the federal government, called Economic Sages.""We need to diversify and decarbonise our energy sources faster than initially planned,"" she says. To help achieve that goal, Ms Grimm wants the nation to ""ramp-up"" its use of hydrogen.Hydrogen can store vast amounts of energy, replace natural gas in industrial processes, and power fuel cells in trucks, trains, ships or planes that emit nothing but vapour of drinkable water.Ms Grimm's enthusiasm is gaining traction, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy research group, dozens of countries have published national hydrogen strategies, or are about to.Despite this flurry of interest, it's not clear yet that the large-scale use of hydrogen can be made viable.After all, there has been similar excitement before: in the 1970s, after two oil crises, and in the 1990s, when climate worries arose. But both petered out. So, is today's hype any different?The answer depends on whom you ask. Environmental groups are cautious, they point out that hydrogen cannot be harvested as a primary fuel. Firstly, it has to be made, mainly in two ways, each marked by a colour code.Green hydrogen is produced by using electricity from renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using an electrolyser. But those machines and the electricity to run them remain costly.These costs means that, at the moment, such emission-free hydrogen makes up only 0.03% of global hydrogen production, according to the IEA.Up to five times cheaper is so-called grey hydrogen, this is derived from natural gas, or in some cases from oil or coal. But due to losses during production, about 50% more CO2 is emitted than if natural gas were directly burned.A related technique is known as blue hydrogen. This relies on the same process, but captures about 60-90% of the carbon emitted in production for re-use or storage.The drawback with this method is that it roughly triples the cost and lacks production facilities at large scale. So it only 0.7% of globally-produced hydrogen is blue.So, despite its environmentally-friendly image and potential, the global production of hydrogen currently emits almost three times as much CO2 as a whole country, France, for instance.Much then will hinges on how countries decide to produce hydrogen.Some countries already have a clear priority - to power electrolysers most sun-baked nations bet on solar power, while France relies on nuclear energy.China meanwhile cherishes cheap grey hydrogen from coal and gas and invests in green alternatives.The US, Canada, UK, Netherlands and Norway are leading the push for blue hydrogen, by injecting captured carbon into oil and gas fields for long-term storage, or for so-called enhanced oil recovery that boosts extraction.In Germany, however, the picture is less clear. Volker Quaschning, professor for renewable energy systems at Berlin's University of Applied Sciences and criticises Germany's hydrogen strategy: ""Merkel's government used it as a red herring to conceal its own failures in the energy transition.""He argues that solar and wind power should have been expanded faster to facilitate future green hydrogen production - a step that Germany's new government has promised to take.However, on hydrogen the three parties in the governing coalition, the three responsible ministries, and the hydrogen council all internally argue whether to concentrate on green hydrogen, or to accept the blue alternative, to temporarily bridge the gap in limited supply. Ms Grimm represents the majority view on the hydrogen council in favouring a multi-colour mix.""Accepting blue hydrogen will help create the supply that we need for a budding industry,"" she argues. ""It will foster technological breakthroughs in Germany and encourage potential suppliers to invest in green hydrogen production.""In January, Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced an ambitious push for renewables and a doubling of the two-year old target for domestic production of green hydrogen to rise by a factor of 150 from 70 MW today to 10 GW by 2030. That target represents a quarter of the entire EU's aim of 40GW, and is larger than France's goal of 6.5 GW.So while this domestic production expands, Germany is looking to source hydrogen from abroad.Andreas Kuhlmann, head of the German Energy Agency, (a government-owned company facilitating the energy transition coordinating the Hydrogen Council), says Germany has dramatically sped-up international negotiations to buy hydrogen.That could include developing hydrogen pipelines to connect to southern Europe, where favourable conditions for solar and wind power allow the cost-efficient production of hydrogen. Mr Habeck is frantically visiting energy exporters. Within one week in March, he travelled to Norway to agree on a feasibility study for the construction of a hydrogen pipeline, went to Qatar to finalise an energy partnership and visited the United Arab Emirates to sign five cooperation agreements.The first deliveries from the UAE are expected to arrive later this year.Other countries on Mr Habeck's hydrogen radar are Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Chile, Namibia and Australia.Though he acknowledges the need to import hydrogen, Mr Quaschning dashes some of Mr Habeck's hopes. ""Importing hydrogen from desert plants will be sluggish, inefficient and expensive,"" he explains.Each step in the supply chain uses up some of the original energy: desalinating sea water to get fresh water as raw material, electrolysis, liquification for shipping, transport via tanker, local transport via pipeline in Germany and re-conversion of hydrogen into electricity.""Together, these steps would eat up at least 70% of the electricity originally produced in the desert,"" Mr Quaschning says.""So, even though a solar panel in the desert produces 80% more electricity than one in Germany, the losses on the way are so big, that it would be twice as effective to directly produce solar power in Germany.""Due to its high-cost, hydrogen is often referred to as the champagne of the energy transition. So, who will get the first sips?On this, most observers agree. ""It is crucial that we allocate hydrogen only to those industries, where direct electrification is not possible"", explains Felix Matthes energy expert at Öko-Institut, a think tank, and member of Germany's hydrogen council.""So, we should first use it in the production of steel, chemicals and glass,"" he argues.Subsequent sectors could be shipping, long distance truck transport, as well as planes for medium or long distances. Other uses in cars or heating are inefficient, costly and impractical distractions, he adds.""Plus, Mr Habeck's new push for renewables will create a greater need to balance our electricity supply, which hydrogen could do with electrolysers producing hydrogen on sunny, windy days as large-scale storage for cloudy winter days,"" Mr Matthes says.The pressure is on Germany to stop spending so much on Russian energy, but it will be a tricky process.Many will be hoping that hydrogen eases that transition by fulfilling its promise this time around."
"4","Climate campaigners refuse to leave Cornwall Council grounds","Climate campaigners have refused to leave a camp set up in the grounds of Cornwall Council headquarters.The campaigners, who want Cornwall Council to drop subsidies for Cornwall Airport, defied a deadline to leave of 19:00 BST on Monday.Martyn Alvey, cabinet member for environment at the council, said the site had no facilities and was unsuitable for overnight camping.No-one from the campaigners was available for immediate comment.The campaigners first set up camp in the grounds at County Hall, Truro on Monday.Mr Alvey said: ""We are not trying to stop them protesting, our concern is overnight camping, there are no facilities.""He said the campaigners had been ""very well behaved"" and there was ""no indication of public disorder at the moment"".However, he was concerned that ""less well intentioned people"" could ""infiltrate the group"".Cornwall Council declared a climate emergency in 2021 but in January officers apologised for not implementing an environmental decision-making policy while assessing plans for a new air service between Newquay and London.Mr Alvey said an air link was ""vital for the economy of Cornwall"" and he supported the subsidy which was £3.35m last year from the council and other sources, according to the airport's accounts.The government also said last November that it would give the council up to £1.8m over two years to run flights from London to Newquay.Addressing some of the concerns of the campaigners, Mr Alvey said the council was ""working very hard to draw in as much funding as possible to insulate houses"".Speaking on Monday, campaigner Dan Sargison from Redruth said: ""We should not be subsidising flights, we should be subsidising public transport heavily.""Jackie Dash from Truro told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""Cornwall has some of the most poorly insulated homes which means that the energy that's used to heat our homes is drifting out of the walls.""I'm a pensioner and I'm really struggling to keep up with my energy bills, so we need to invest strongly in green technologies.""Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

"4","Ryedale fracking wells could be re-purposed for geothermal power","Twelve wells which were meant to be used for fracking could be re-purposed to produce geothermal power.Studies are under way in Ryedale, North Yorkshire, to see if natural heat can be drawn from gas extraction wells to power homes with renewable energy.The wells, including some near Pickering and Kirby Misperton, are thousands of feet deep and one contains water heated at up to 90C (194F).The scheme would be the first in the UK, said the wells' owner Third Energy. The company said it had begun investigations to establish if the wells could be used in this way. It said there were ""early indications that at least some of the wells"", which are also located in the Dalby and Wykeham forests, would be suitable.Ryedale District Council received a £50,000 government grant to help fund the work, which has been matched by Third Energy, whose new owners are no longer interested in using the wells for fracking or gas extraction.Geothermal energy uses steam created from hot water found deep underground to power turbines and produce electricity.Russell Hoare, managing director of Third Energy, said: ""This is potentially a sustainable energy source right under our feet. ""Given the urgent need to decarbonise the energy system and eliminate fuel poverty, we are pleased to be working with Ryedale District Council and the government to address these two issues.""A Ryedale councillor who campaigned against fracking has given his support to the scheme. Liberal Mike Potter said: ""It's quite ironic that five or six years ago I was on the other side of the fence trying to oppose fracking. ""I think it's brilliant that Third Energy have, you could say, woken up.""The potential of this project is very exciting.

"4","The changing face of the North Sea oil industry","In Europe's oil capital, everyone knows the boom times are over.Faced with the climate emergency, Aberdeen is having to move away from an industry that has created half a million jobs and brought almost incalculable wealth to north east Scotland.But what happens next? Some young people are still banking on a career in the oil industry. Others are focusing on a future in renewable energy. As politicians argue over a ""just transition"" to a greener future, thousands of jobs and the future of the planet depend on finding the right answers. At Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University (RGU), drilling and well engineering students are still hopeful of pursuing a career in oil and gas. The vast majority are from parts of the world where energy transition is not so high up the political agenda - and many have no plans to stay in Scotland after they graduate. They know that the world is still dependent on fossil fuels to heat homes, fuel vehicles and power industry. Despite the moves towards producing more clean energy in Scotland, more than three-quarters (76.5%) of the country's energy consumption came from oil and gas in 2019. Affan Peshimam, 30, from India, is following in the footsteps of his father who worked in the oil and gas sector in the North Sea.He said: ""I love the smell of petrol. I love working offshore away from civilisation.""And he's convinced that he can enjoy a full career in the industry in India once he's graduated in Aberdeen.""There's still a lot of oil remaining, at least 30 or 40 years more,"" he said. ""Every time they say the peak has come, I don't think so. Maybe for the North Sea.""For certain parts of the world where there's no oil left, the peak has come. But in Africa and India and the Far East we still have so much reserves left we can't just keep them. ""Of course we have started some solar but we are still dependent on oil and gas. And coal, obviously.""  Affan is right about the North Sea - production peaked about 20 years ago and since then the UK has gone from producing more oil and gas than it needs, to importing it from other countries. As prices rise following the Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this has raised concerns about UK energy security. It has led to calls from some quarters for more oil fields - like the controversial Cambo field - to be opened to offset decades of decline. Ryan Crighton, of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said the growing energy deficit leaves Scotland with two choices: ""To produce more domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted. Or to import more energy from overseas, without the tax revenues that the North Sea gives us. ""The latter makes little economic sense and even less environmental sense.""Others - including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - argue that accelerating the transition to more renewable forms of energy is the best response to the crisis. Eta Etta-Agbor, another drilling and well engineering student at RGU, knows she is acquiring skills which could be transferred to the renewables industry, if it comes to it. But the 42-year-old from Nigeria - which has some of the largest oil reserves in Africa - aspires to work for one of the majors like Shell or Chevron. ""What we are learning here, I could easily switch into the (renewables) industry but the fact is there will still be lots of drilling taking place,"" she said. And she pointed to the importance of gas in generating electricity - the UK, and England and Wales in particular, still relies on it heavily. ""Gas is essentially like the next fuel that can be used for electricity so we'll still be drilling more gas in the future so I'll still be relevant in the industry,"" she said. But over the next decade the mix of fuel generating electricity in Scotland will be transformed beyond recognition. Coal power will end and many of our nuclear power stations will come to the end of their lives. Offshore wind is likely to become the powerhouse of our economy.The ScotWind leasing round alone, announced in January, will generate enough electricity when it's at maximum capacity to power about 85% of the UK's homes.It will see 17 new offshore wind projects built in waters around Scotland, with each expected to spend an average of £1.5bn on its supply chain. The projects - many backed by big name oil and gas firms with the deep pockets necessary to invest in new technology - will also need a new workforce. Their existing employees are among those switching to the greener jobs.Harry Waugh was initially attracted to the oil and gas industry because of his love of engineering, problem-solving and ""big things"". He worked as an engineer in oil and gas for 11 years before moving into renewables as a project manager for an offshore wind farm. There is a ""ridiculous amount"" of experience among his former colleagues which could be transferred into offshore renewables, the 34-year-old from Perth said. And as wages in the renewable sector begin to equal those in oil and gas, he expects to see more people make the leap. But he warned that green jobs were unlikely to be able to replace every traditional North Sea position. There were 4,700 full time equivalent jobs supported by Scotland's offshore wind industry in 2019, compared to 86,000 oil and gas jobs in the same year. ""An offshore oil and gas production plant is quite a complicated beast,"" he said. ""A $3bn oil and gas plant will have 100 people offshore; a $3bn wind farm will have nobody offshore.""It's not a job-for-job situation. In development and commissioning, it's the same numbers but as soon as the turbines are spinning, it flicks to a different beast.""As the offshore wind industry begins to ramp up, Ryan Crighton is clear that Scotland must avoid a ""cliff edge"" end to North Sea oil and gas production. ""We need to keep this highly-skilled [oil and gas] workforce in work while we develop the low carbon technologies of the future,"" the policy director of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce said. ""Those jobs aren't there at scale right now. However, if we can manage this transition correctly, then research suggests we could end up with more people employed in our energy sector than we do right now. That is the outcome we should strive for.""This region will benefit from being one of the first to tackle these challenges, and over time has the potential to become a net exporter of net zero.""And BP's head of UK operations, Louise Kingham agrees. She said they are ""quite convinced"" enough jobs can be created in its alternative energies business to replace those lost by the shift away from oil. ""We have real ambition to make sure that we can provide opportunities for people to move from one aspect of the energy work that we do to another.""It's not just the engineers on the rigs who are seeing huge changes in Aberdeen's energy industry. Many of those in businesses which have long supported oil and gas firms' traditional operations are adapting to changing priorities. Among them are firms like North Star, which started out in fishing before the oil boom of the 1970s saw them dip their toe in new waters. They now have dozens of ships supporting the oil and gas sector but have just won contracts to provide vessels for the Dogger Bank wind farm off the north east coast of England.Their cadet training programme creates the next generation of mariners to support whatever industry is out there.Engine cadet Courtney Stanton is responsible for machinery maintenance on the Grampian Freedom, a 980 tonne standby vessel with a length of 58 metres.She explained: ""As long as there's going to be oil rigs in the sea there's always going to need to be a standby ship or a supply ship.""She said the addition of the renewables sector is a ""welcome and needed change"" and believes it would be exciting to work in this area.But at the start of her career she is not fazed saying ""jobs will be created which is brilliant and with us in the merchant navy, we tend to go to where the demand is.""Meanwhile Paul Hudson runs Maersk Training's UK operation, which is centred on Aberdeen. He explained: ""We all know the pace of energy transition is picking up so we, like other businesses, just have to adapt to that.  It's why we've made investments in new facilities specific to the renewables industry for example.""Those new facilities at their Portlethen site, south of Aberdeen, focus on rope and climbing skills as well as more traditional needs like firefighting.Workers are more likely to travel to wind turbines by boat rather than helicopter which is more common for rigs.Paul adds that demand for renewable skills is growing but ""for us, oil and gas will still remain a big part of the throughput of training that we do."""
"4","'Democratic' jackdaws use noise to make decisions","Jackdaws use a ""democratic"" process to decide when to leave their roosts en masse, scientists have discovered.Thousands of jackdaws can suddenly take to the morning skies in winter, creating a whirling black cloud of creatures.Researchers have now found that the birds call out when they want to leave. Then when the noise reaches a critical level, it signals the roost is ready to depart, and the birds fly away.It's a rare insight into how animals make group decisions, Alex Thornton, professor of cognitive evolution at University of Exeter, told BBC News.""When a bird calls, it's casting a vote or signalling it wants to leave,"" Prof Thornton explains. The collective decision to depart then rests on two things.The first is noise volume and the second is the crescendo or how rapidly the noise levels increase.Once the birds reach consensus, the roost of thousands launches from the tree within five seconds on average, forming one of the famous winter UK spectacles.When the noise levels rise more rapidly, the roost leaves earlier, the researchers say.In Norfolk roosts of 40,000 jackdaws have been observed leaving trees en masse.Jackdaws want to leave the trees together because it protects them against predators or is useful for ""information-sharing"", Prof Thornton suggests.""If you're flying off altogether, you might notice that another individual is particularly well-fed or you can tell from their calls that they've eaten. You might realise that's a bird worth following to find a good place for a meal,"" Prof Thornton explains.To observe the birds' behaviour, scientists attached audio recorders to trees where jackdaws roost in Cornwall over two winters.Led by Masters student Alex Dibnah, the researchers analysed the sounds and compared the noise to times at which the birds left the trees.To test their findings, the scientists played back the recordings at jackdaws and observed that the roosts responded to the sounds, departing six minutes earlier on average.When wind noises were played instead, the birds did not leave, indicating that jackdaws responded specifically to calls rather than simply noise disturbance.Other birds may behave similarly but scientists haven't yet studied it in detail, Prof Thornton explains. The findings will help scientists understand the effect of human activities on animal populations, he says.People are increasingly creating disturbances to birds through light and noise pollution, which may be interfering with animals ability to communicate with each other.""Imagine a big roost near a town or busy road. If the birds can't hear other other and can't form a consensus to leave together, it could have big impacts on their population,"" Prof Thornton explains.The research is published in the journal Current Biology."

But a lot of people don't have that time outside and that's why they need supplements. The tomatoes themselves could provide another source of vitamin D in their diet.""If government legislation gets through Parliament successfully, the vitamin-boosting fruits could be among the first gene-edited crops allowed on supermarket shelves in England.Gene editing is a relatively recent technology. It involves switching genes on and off by snipping out a small section of the plant's DNA. The older technique of genetic modification involves putting genes in, sometimes from a completely different species.EU restrictions mean both methods have been effectively banned in Europe for a quarter century. Both methods are used in other countries, to produce food. But the EU set stringent regulations on GM crops 25 years ago because of safety concerns and public opposition to the technology. Gene-edited crops are covered by the same regulations.The UK currently follows European Union regulations on both technologies.Any new GM or GE crop must undergo a scientific safety assessment, which can take around five years. Plant breeders believe that to be too onerous and expensive and so do not invest in the technology in Europe. In addition, any new variety that passes the EU's safety tests must then be approved by a majority at the European Parliament. Plant breeders believe that political opposition is too strong for the approval of new GM or GE varieties. The regulations, say the plant industry, effectively prevented the commercial production of GM foods in Europe. The UK government has decided that gene editing is safe to use and is to introduce a bill on Wednesday to allow its commercial development in England. The regulations on GM crops will not be relaxed at this stage.The Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC News that the change in the law was necessary to combat the impact of climate change. ''The reality is  we're going to need more drought resistant plants and as we try and reduce the use of chemical pesticides, we need to breed in the natural resistance of plants to diseases and this precision breeding technology gives you the ability to do that; it gives you the ability to change traits in a plant faster than you could by conventional breeding but it's not the same as genetic modification''.The development has been welcomed by Nigel Moore, of KWS, a plant-breeding firm in Hertfordshire which produces wheat and barley. ""With the varieties we see in England, it generally takes us 12 years to produce those new ones. With gene-editing, we can respond to changing farmers' much faster.""KWS has been developing new varieties of wheat and barley for farmers for 150 years using traditional cross-breeding techniques. Mr Moore says that the firm needs to use gene-editing to produce the new varieties farmers are asking for.""If we think about the pace of change: climate change, the need to reduce nitrogen fertilizer, need to use less pesticides; the faster we get the genetic changes we need, the faster we are able to adapt to all of that changing world around us"".Critics of the technology, such as Liz O'Neill, who is the director of the campaign group, GM Freeze, says that the government is being too hasty in lifting restrictions for gene-edited crops.""Mistakes happen. Other changes can get made. Genetics is not like Lego. It is a new set of techniques, and it has developed very quickly which means that there is an awful lot that could go wrong.The process does involve putting genetic material in, in order to take it out, and there is a deliberate oversimplification in the description of the process in order to make people feel comfortable about it.""Ms O'Neill also wonders how the relaxation of regulations, which apply to England only, won't happen in other parts of the UK, which will make their own decisions about the use of the technology. ""The food chain doesn't operate only in England. It operates across the UK. Who is going to keep gene-edited food out of the food in Scotland and Wales?Customers want informed choice and can only get that if GMOs in the food chain are traceable"".Nigel Moore from KWS responds by saying that new gene-edited crop varieties are analysed to ensure that there is no new DNA in them before they are approved for use and that a number of scientific assessments have judged gene-editing technology to be safe.He also believes that English-grown GE foods won't find their way to other parts of the UK.""Agricultural supply chains are already very competent in delivering brand requirements such as gluten free and organic foods to very high standards.""The Scottish Government has a long standing opposition to GM crops. Their argument is that they want to protect the ""purity"" of Scotland's food and drinks sector. But this is now is direct opposition to NFU Scotland which says it puts Scottish farmers at a competitive disadvantage.A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We have no plans to revise the existing GMO Deliberate Release Regulations in Wales and will maintain our precautionary approach towards genetic modification.GM crop growing in Northern Ireland was banned at the same time as in Scotland and Wales, back in 2015, and it was said then that that decision would hold for the foreseeable future.Follow Pallab on Twitter"
"4","Climate campaigners set up camp on Cornwall Council grounds","Climate campaigners have set up camp outside County Hall in Truro, urging Cornwall Council for an ""urgent increase in commitment and action"".They are planning to be there for two weeks and will be running a series of workshops and training.Organisers said topics to be covered included the environmental emergency, the housing crisis in Cornwall, green energy and food sustainability.Cornwall Council has been contacted for a comment.Environmental campaigners from across the county are at the camp.On Tuesday, they plan to welcome people attending the council's annual general meeting (AGM).Charlie Lewin is one those at the camp and said: ""Cornwall Council has made some headway towards its goal of net zero carbon emissions for Cornwall by 2030. ""But, sadly, this goal is utterly unattainable without a dramatic and urgent increase in commitment and action.""He added: ""Our camp is here to increase pressure on the council to challenge the status quo, step outside of their comfort zone, and get on the right side of history. ""We hope very much that councillors and council staff will embrace the opportunity that this camp affords.""Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

"4","Shropshire farmer urges others to help create 'bee road' meadows","A farmer is encouraging more farms to follow his lead and plant wildflower meadows to help bees flourish.Chris Jerman, from Chirbury in Shropshire, started growing the meadows in 2019 for pollinating insects and said the response had been brilliant.""The amount of goodwill it has created in the local community has been fantastic,"" he said.Mr Jerman has encouraged neighbouring farms to follow suit and create a ""bee road"" for the insects.The idea is to create a network of wildflower meadows so bees can fly around the countryside and always find a food source easily.""Rather than say one farmer that maybe grew 300 acres of this... far better that 300 farmers just grow an acre of it,"" Mr Jerman said.Milk co-operative Arla Foods UK organised the project and said they wanted to reverse the decline in bees in recent years.The insects play an important role in pollinating flowers and plants and the fall in their numbers due to changing temperatures and pesticides has been well documented.An expert on wildflowers worked with Mr Jerman, helping him to choose a variety of species which bloom at different times during the year.""What is ideal about them is they do not like fertile land so we do not have to give up the best bits of the farm that produce all your food,"" he said. ""If anything we want the worst bits.""As well as helping bees to thrive, Mr Jerman said the relationship was mutually beneficial as the insects go on to pollinate crops.""It's really important we find that balance on farms between producing food for the consumer and also producing food for biodiversity,"" he said.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"4","Sark: Wind farm firm suggests rat cull to protect seabirds","Black rats could be culled in Sark to offset disturbances to seabirds caused by wind turbines in England.Energy firm Orsted said culling the predators could increase the birds' survival chances on the island and help maintain British Isles populations.The aim is to compensate for a planned wind farm called Hornsea Four with 180 turbines about 40 miles (65km) off Flamborough Head in Yorkshire.A survey has been handed to all Sark residents to gather their opinions.Concerns have been raised that the new English turbines will disturb seabirds, which often come to Sark as part of their migrations. It is thought reducing rats in Sark will protect the bird populations overall if they are affected in Yorkshire.Mike Day, from renewable energy company Orsted, said ""islands and islets in the Bailiwick of Guernsey"" were on a ""short-list of potential locations for a compensation measure"".He said the survey would ""determine feasibility and effectiveness of the various compensation measures options available"". ""This includes two studies into the presence and impact of predators, such as rats, on the islands of Alderney, Herm, Sark and their nearby islets and stacks,"" he said.Birds affected by predators on Sark included puffins, guillemots and razorbills, said Sark resident and wildlife photographer Sue Daly.""You do not want rats in your house, but I cannot see that they are causing that much trouble for wildlife,"" she said.""We have other predators too, like feral cats, crows and magpies, and it would not be possible to get rid of them all.""I am not a rat fan; I am against what seems to be complete greenwash.""It is believed the company is due to hold a public meeting later in the year.Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Mr Rush, from Upton, Dorset, said the ""absolutely brutal"" challenge was ""the hardest thing"" he has completed.Last August, he completed a 15-hour swim around the Isle of Wight to highlight marine pollution.The plasterer was able to walk from the sea unaided but was taken in an ambulance to hospital after completing his latest feat. He was partnered by charities Plastic Free Cayman and Project Planet in his challenge, and has so far raised more than £18,000 online. ""I got round but it was absolutely brutal, it was so, so difficult,"" he said.""It took me to some very dark places and I literally wanted to ocean to swallow me up.""""I was never going to quit because I was so motivated by the environmental cause and what humans are doing to the planet, but it was the hardest thing I've ever done.""My food plan went out of the window after four hours and there were channels I had to swim through by myself because the support kayaks couldn't get through due to the swell.""There were some sections where I was making little to no progress against the currents."" Mr Rush said there were ""no major incidents"" during the swim, as he battled through difficult conditions that left him with a tongue so swollen he found drinking difficult. He added: ""It is too early to say what I'll do next but I'll continue to raise awareness about sea pollution and no doubt when I get home I'll be on beaches clearing them of plastics.""Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

"4","Tree planting 'must triple to hit environment aims'","Tree planting in Northern Ireland needs to at least triple to meet official targets, according to a UK forestry industry body.Confor has called on any new administration to prioritise an updated forestry strategy.This should include incentives and targets to boost wood production and support jobs, as well as help reach net zero. The Department for Agriculture said it was committed to planting more trees.Confor chief executive Stuart Goodall said growing wood locally can cut emissions. ""It means that the benefits of that tree planting are kept local as well,"" he said.""Planting productive forests creates additional employment and, because of the strength of the market for wood, we're seeing timber prices increasing significantly.""That's an opportunity for the farming community to gain some value from marginal land, as well as the jobs associated downstream.""It is two years since the Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots announced a target of planting 18 million trees by 2030.  That requires an average of 900 hectares a year to be planted.  But figures show just 200 to 300 hectares are currently being afforested each year.  ""We have lots of spare land that isn't producing and isn't being used productively, and that could be used for forests,"" said Brian Murphy, chief executive of timber business Balcas.""Each hectare is perhaps absorbing 12 to 20 tonnes of carbon every year over the life of that and you can imagine that it is a lot of CO2 taken out of the atmosphere.  ""That will help Northern Ireland achieve some of its climate targets, and we have a lot to achieve.""Confor members are calling for more commercial planting as well planting for environmental purposes, which usually includes slower-growing native species like oak and ash.  ""Northern Ireland's typical land use is agriculture, forestry is a very good alternative land use but it's changing the perception and the mindset,"" said Ross Jamieson, of RJ Woodland Services Ltd.  ""We really need to triple what we're doing at the moment.  ""The ideal balance would be if we could maybe get about 75% commercial and 25% environmental, within every woodland.  ""Obviously every site has differences, and we need to be site specific, but that would be an ideal balance, and that would allow us to have our environmental, our native woodland that will grow on and remain for a long time and then we can also have our commercial element which will be on a shorter rotation.""Those commercial trees are species like conifers and sitka spruce.  ""Northern Ireland has the capability of growing much more timber that can be used in this country,"" Mr Jamieson said.  ""All you have to do is look around your own home or your farm and you'll see how much timber is used, from toilet paper to writing paper to fence posts, garden sheds.  ""The ground we really want to plant in Northern Ireland is the marginal, the upland ground that's not just completely environmentally sensitive but it's not the prime agricultural ground either.  ""We want to be hitting the middle ground and the financial incentive on that sort of ground is not as good as it could be.""A Department of Agriculture spokesman said: ""The minister remains completely committed to increasing forest cover in Northern Ireland in line with our long-term forestry strategy, to achieve 12% cover by 2050 and any suggestion otherwise is misleading. ""The minister brought an urgent focus to realising this over the next decade, though the Forests for our Future programme in 2020, where he committed to 9,000 hectares of new woodland over the 10 year period, in line with UK Committee for Climate Change recommendations. ""Since 2020, we've tripled the amount of new woodland meeting our targets in the first two years and are on track to achieving 95% of the target this year. ""We will set future years' targets in collaboration with delivering agricultural and environmental policies to help us achieve our ambitious long-term goals, and will continue to work alongside public sector organisations in order to maximise our forest cover."""

""They're surviving and thriving so please don't feed the red kites - it's far better to enjoy them soaring high above our gardens or in their natural environment on a walk in the Chilterns hills.""The birds started breeding in the Chilterns in 1992 and it is thought there could be more than 1,000 breeding pairs in the area.Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
