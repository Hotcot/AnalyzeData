"2","Rangers oust Hurricanes 6-2 in Game 7, reach Eastern finals","2a43a8a688c9d6877144e7da5d63dda4","https://apnews.com/article/nhl-sports-chris-kreider-ryan-strome-filip-chytil-2a43a8a688c9d6877144e7da5d63dda4","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Nothing is fazing these New York Rangers, not multi-game series deficit nor playing in a building where no road team has won in the Stanley Cup playoffs.Instead, this resilient bunch is carrying an ever-growing confidence straight into the Eastern Conference finals, thanks to another Game 7 win and the latest strong performance from possibly the game’s best goaltender.Chris Kreider scored twice, Igor Shesterkin was strong in net again and the Rangers ended Carolina’s perfect postseason run at home, beating the Hurricanes 6-2 in the decisive Game 7 of their second-round playoff series Monday night.Kreider and Adam Fox had first-period power-play goals as the Rangers raced to a quick lead. The Rangers then rode Shesterkin’s latest offense-stymieing performance to win a fifth straight elimination game win in these playoffs. “Backs against the wall five times now,” Fox said, “and we’ve come through all five.”Shesterkin — a finalist for both the Vezina Trophy for the league’s top goalie and Hart Trophy for most valuable player — finished with 36 saves and carried the shutout well into the third period.Now the Rangers are off to a conference final for the first time since 2015, earning a matchup with two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay. New York will host Game 1 of that series Wednesday night.Ryan Strome and Filip Chytil also scored in what became an unexpected rout, with Andrew Copp adding a late empty-netter. More impressively, the Rangers’ win came in an arena where the Hurricanes had gone 7-0 in the playoffs, including a Game 7 victory to beat Boston in the first round and three meetings in this series.New York coach Gerard Gallant said Sunday he had a group of players who “have a lot of fun and they believe in themselves.” They looked as if they were doing plenty of both Monday in capping a second straight comeback win from a multi-game deficit.First, they rallied from a 3-1 down to beat Pittsburgh in a seven-game series. Then, after falling in an 0-2 hole against Carolina, New York responded with more resilience, even a stubborn refusal to fade out when down.Kreider went as far as to throw in a comparison to “cockroaches.”“We don’t go away, regardless of the score, regardless of where our game is at,” Kreider said.There were no questions about that Monday night, particularly with Shesterkin holding up against 17 first-period shots. That included one stop from flat on his back on Sebastian Aho near the right post, with Shesterkin snagging the puck between his legs flailing, as if trying to make a snow angel late in the first period.The Rangers also helped by blocking 25 shots in front of him.“You’ve got to pay a price to win games in this league, especially against real good teams like that,” Gallant said. ” I love the way our guys are competing and battling. I’ve said 100 times this year, we’re not perfect but we find ways to win.”Vincent Trocheck finally beat Shesterkin with a deflection on a Tony DeAngelo shot midway through the third period, only to see the Rangers follow with Chytil’s goal just 40 seconds later to push the margin to 5-1.Max Domi also scored a late goal for the Hurricanes. But Carolina lost top-line rookie forward Seth Jarvis to a first-period injury after a jarring high hit from Jacob Trouba, and then lost goaltender Antti Raanta to an apparent right-leg injury in the second period in an all-around rough night. Raanta had 16 saves before his injury, while rookie Pyotr Kochetkov allowed three goals on 12 shots in relief.“Tonight was kind of just some bounces, everyone wasn’t quite there, including myself,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. “An unfortunate way to end the series — season.”Carolina’s playoff success had leaned on its home-ice advantage, backed by a rowdy crowd. But its inability to win a single road game in the postseason only shrunk the Hurricanes’ margin for error and turned winning at home into an absolute necessity to keep playing.As a result, the first and only home stumble proved fatal, a crushing end to a season that saw the division winner, with the third-best record in the NHL, set franchise records for regular-season wins (54) and points (116) with aspirations of winning its second Cup. “It’s definitely a bummer to have the team — the caliber of team — that we did,” Carolina defenseman Jaccob Slavin said, “and not go farther.”NO FIRSTSThe Hurricanes were 6-0 in Game 7s since the former Hartford Whalers relocated to North Carolina in 1997. They were trying to become the first team in NHL history to win seven straight Game 7s.Carolina was also trying to become the first to win multiple best-of-seven series in the same postseason with zero road wins.ELIMINATION-GAME PRODUCTIONWhen Fox scored and assisted on Kreider’s first goal, that pushed him to 10 points in elimination games during this postseason. According to ESPN Stats & Info, that marks the most by a defenseman in a single postseason, surpassing Ray Bourque in 1980, Ian Turnbull in 1976 and Denis Potvin in 1975.INJURED CANESJarvis was knocked from the game on Trouba’s hit, which sent him sprawling to the ice and left him able only to crawl back to the bench. When he made it there, he was too wobbly to sit on the bench and needed assistance from teammates to get directed into the locker room.Making matters worse, the Hurricanes took a penalty for too many men on the ice while trying to sub for Jarvis, leading to Kreider’s first goal.Ranta went down with 4:23 left in the second period when he extended his right leg in a split to make a stop on Mika Zibanejad. He almost went forward and landed face down on the ice. He was eventually helped off the ice by teammates Vincent Trocheck and Nino Niederreiter, not putting any weight on his right leg.Afterward, coach Rod Brind’Amour said Raanta’s injury would have prevented him from playing the next series, had Carolina won.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","At French Open, Swiatek loses set, extends match win streak","8d32e254d6f875a092a2a4e3b6ca981f","https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-french-open-rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic-nhl-8d32e254d6f875a092a2a4e3b6ca981f","PARIS (AP) — The loss of one set by a player is normally not the stuff of headlines at a Grand Slam tournament. That did constitute news at the French Open on Monday, because the player was No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek and it had been more than a month since that happened to her.The way it came about was noteworthy, too: She led the first set of her fourth-round match against 74th-ranked Zheng Qinwen of China 3-0, then 5-2, and was a point from claiming it on five occasions but could not seal the deal. Swiatek entered the day having won 20 sets in a row, and 48 of her preceding 49.All that truly mattered, in the end, was that 2020 champion Swiatek would not lose another set on this cloudy evening, getting past the hard-swinging Zheng 6-7 (5), 6-0, 6-2 to return to the quarterfinals at Roland Garros and run her winning streak to 32 consecutive matches.“I’m pretty happy I could come back after a pretty frustrating first set when I had the lead,” Swiatek said. “Pretty happy with myself that I’m still in the tournament.”Swiatek regrouped by changing tactics — she sped up her forehand instead of absorbing Zheng’s power — and in a less conventional way, too, deciding to change her tune. No, really: She switched which song she was singing in her head during the match.“It was Dua Lipa,” Swiatek said, “so kind of a guilty pleasure.”She has won her past five tournaments, going unbeaten since February for the WTA’s longest such stretch since Serena Williams compiled a 34-match run in 2013. With 23-time Grand Slam champion Williams absent from the tour for nearly a year, and Swiatek’s predecessor atop the rankings, two-time major winner Ash Barty, having recently retired, there is no dominant figure in women’s tennis to mount a challenge.Next to try to stop Swiatek will be 11th-seeded Jessica Pegula, who advanced to her third major quarterfinal — and first in Paris — with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania, who was fined $10,000 last week when she threw her racket and it bounced into the stands, brushing a child in a front-row seat.Pegula, owner of a 2-3 record at Roland Garros before this year, saw two sides to taking on Swiatek, who beat her on a hard court at the Miami Open in March.“Sometimes you’re like, ‘Oh, I wish I didn’t play her in the quarterfinals. I wish I played one of the other people and didn’t meet her so early,’” Pegula said. “But at the same time, it’s a great chance to have a great win and a great story.”The other women’s quarterfinal Wednesday will be between two Russians: No. 20 Daria Kasatkina and No. 29 Veronika Kudermetova. They were teammates on the team that won the Billie Jean King Cup last year — Russia was barred from trying to defend that title because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine — and have known each other since they were kids, squaring off as juniors as long ago as 2011.Pegula, whose parents own the NFL’s Buffalo Bills and NHL’s Buffalo Sabres, joins two other American women in the quarterfinals.Coco Gauff, an 18-year-old seeded 18th, and Sloane Stephens, the 2017 U.S. Open champion and 2018 French Open runner-up, face each other on Tuesday, when the other women’s matchup will be No. 17 Leylah Fernandez, a 19-year-old from Canada, against 54th-ranked Martina Trevisan of Italy.The most-anticipated men’s quarterfinal will be the 59th career meeting between defending champion Novak Djokovic and 13-time champion Rafael Nadal on Tuesday night. Also Tuesday, No. 3 Alexander Zverev plays No. 6 Carlos Alcaraz, a 19-year-old from Spain.Men’s matches Wednesday are No. 7 Andrey Rublev against 2014 U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic, and Holger Rune, a 19-year-old from Denmark, against No. 8 Casper Ruud, a 23-year-old from Norway. Cilic swept past 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 in Monday’s last match, adding the departure of the men’s No. 2 seed to that of No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas earlier in the day. With Rune, who eliminated 2021 runner-up Tsitsipas 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, and Alcaraz still in the field, it’s the first time in 28 years that two teens made the men’s quarterfinals at any Grand Slam tournament.Zheng is 19, and Swiatek is just 20. Both are capable of playing like veterans.Zheng, though, said she found it “tough to show my level,” because of stomach cramps and an issue with her right leg, which was taped by a trainer during a medical timeout at 3-0 in the second set. That was during a span where Swiatek grabbed eight straight games.When it ended, Swiatek screamed “Come on!” and shook her right fist as she looked at the excited faces in her guest box.“For sure, these matches are emotional for everybody,” she said, “because they are tight and not easy.”Been a while since that was the case for her. ___More AP Tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","Analysis: Might Djokovic vs. Nadal, Part 59, be their last?","6833d99d445bc66b2bc131dee755c842","https://apnews.com/article/french-open-novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-sports-6833d99d445bc66b2bc131dee755c842","PARIS (AP) — This French Open is the first Grand Slam tournament in a year with both Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in the field. And anyone who enjoys men’s tennis — or, indeed, sports — should be thrilled that those two titans of the game will face each other for a record 59th time.Is it a shame Tuesday night’s match is “only” a quarterfinal, instead of something with more at stake? Perhaps. Will that dissuade anyone from watching from afar or dull the atmosphere that’ll envelop Court Philippe Chatrier? Doubtful.Could it decrease the intensity of each player’s performance? Not a chance.“I’m ready for it,” Djokovic said.“I hope to be able to give myself a chance to play at the highest level possible,” Nadal said, “and then let’s see.”So then the question that Nadal will have on his mind — and we know so because he said so — and Djokovic might, too, is: How many more of these showdowns are there going to be?First of all, Nadal turns 36 on Friday; Djokovic turned 35 on May 22, the first day of the French Open.“I don’t know what can happen in the near future with my career,” Nadal said.His body has been a big issue over the past 12 months. He missed the last half of last season, including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, because of chronic pain in his left foot that flared up again in recent weeks. After his 20-0 start to 2022, he missed three tournaments because of a rib injury.“I can’t complain much,” Nadal said, noting that 2 1/2 weeks ago he had no idea whether he’d make it this far.“Being honest, every match that I play here, I don’t know if it’s going to be my last match here in Roland Garros. ... That’s my situation now,” he said after edging 21-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime in five sets Sunday night. “That’s why I am just trying to enjoy as much as possible.”Auger-Aliassime said Nadal did not appear to be hampered or slowed at all during their fourth-round thriller, which lasted nearly 4 1/2 hours, almost twice as long as Djokovic’s straight-set win Sunday over 15th-seeded Diego Schwartzman.Djokovic hasn’t dropped a set through four matches.“He’s Novak,” Schwartzman said, “and if you are not 100% ... obviously, the result is like this.”As for Djokovic, his decision to not get vaccinated against COVID-19 prevented him from participating at the Australian Open and, while he’s been assured that won’t be a problem at Wimbledon when it starts June 27, his status for the U.S. Open is uncertain at the moment.Whether statistics, aesthetics or any other measures is applied, both are among the greatest there’s ever been. About that there can be no debate.Both have won every Grand Slam tournament at least twice. Nadal owns a men’s-record 21 Slam titles, a number he reached with a tiebreaking triumph at the Australian Open in January. Djokovic, like Roger Federer, is one behind. Djokovic has all sorts of other bona fides, including more weeks spent at No. 1 in the ATP rankings than anyone else and the only man with at least two trophies from every Masters event. He also leads both Federer and Nadal head to head.Djokovic and Nadal have played each other more frequently than any other pair of men in the half-century-plus of professional tennis. Djokovic leads 30-28 overall; Nadal leads 19-8 on clay, including 7-2 at Roland Garros. Nadal is 109-3 at the French Open, with a record 13 championships, and two of those three losses came against Djokovic, including in the semifinals a year ago en route to the title.“Playing him in Roland Garros is always a physical battle,” Djokovic said, “along with everything else.”This one is such a big deal that it was scheduled for the night session, even though Nadal made it clear he prefers playing daytime matches on clay, and it’s been made available for free to everyone in France via a streaming service under a special arrangement.Whoever wins will take on third-seeded Alexander Zverev or sixth-seeded Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals. The other men’s quarterfinals are No. 7 Andrey Rublev vs. No. 20 Marin Cilic, and No. 8 Casper Ruud vs. unseeded Holger Rune.Alcaraz, the 19-year-old Spaniard considered the Next Big Thing in men’s tennis, knows a significant match when he sees one coming.“If I can,” Alcaraz said about Djokovic vs. Nadal, “I will watch it.”___Howard Fendrich has been the AP’s main tennis writer since 2002.

A few other San Francisco players stood on the chalk line past the third-base bag during their stretching exercises. “Today, I’ll be standing for the anthem,” Kapler wrote earlier Monday on his blog. “While I believe strongly in the right to protest and the importance of doing so, I also believe strongly in honoring and mourning our country’s service men and women who fought and died for that right. Those who serve in our military, and especially those who have paid the ultimate price for our rights and freedoms, deserve that acknowledgment and respect, and I am honored to stand on the line today to show mine.”Kapler announced on Friday that he intended to remain in the clubhouse during the anthem to protest “the lack of delivery of the promise of what our national anthem represents” following the shootings that killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.“The way I see it is anything that sparks thoughtful conversation is good,” Kapler told reporters on Monday.Kapler said he was not ready to announce whether his protest will resume on Tuesday night.“The days move really fast,” he said. “We’re going to come out and talk about Giants and Phillies today and we’ll get into the game and then we’ll spend some time trying to get away from the game. Then the game starts the next day. I want to have my thoughts perfectly formulated. I will formulate them and I will share them. I just don’t have them right now.”Joe Girardi replaced Kapler as Philadelphia’s manager following the 2019 season“Everyone has a choice in this country, right?” Girardi said. “I mean that’s what America is founded on. It’s not the choice that I’ll make. But with all the choices we make in life there are consequences, no matter what you do, so you have to be prepared to explain why you do things in this world. And it’s not something that I would do.”___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

He left the Houston Astros after seven seasons to sign a $105.3 million, three-year contract in March, a deal that allows him to opt out after the 2022 and 2023 seasons.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

The teams split their two regular-season meetings, each winning on the other’s home floor.The Warriors have been waiting for an opponent since this past Thursday after needing only five games to beat Dallas for the West title. The Celtics got there the hard way, winning Game 7 in Miami on Sunday night to capture the East.“We stayed with it. We believed in each other. We made a commitment on the defensive end,” said Celtics forward Al Horford, who, after 141 playoff games, is headed to the NBA Finals for the first time. “That was the biggest thing, defending.”For the Celtics, it’s a chance at an 18th NBA championship — which would break the tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most in league history. For the Warriors, it’s a chance at a seventh crown — which would break a tie with the Chicago Bulls for third-most in league history.It’s also a rematch of the 1964 finals, when Bill Russell and the Celtics topped the Warriors in five games.“I’ve said it many times: You go to the finals, it’s almost a two-month journey filled with stress and fatigue and everything else,” said Kerr, who gave his team Friday and Saturday off before bringing them back to work Sunday. “So, if you can get a little bit of a break, it’s very meaningful. Hopefully, we can get healthy and have a few days of really good prep and be ready to go on Thursday.”Golden State won at Boston 111-107 on Dec. 17, behind 30 points from Stephen Curry. The Celtics rolled on Golden State’s home floor in the rematch on March 16, winning 110-88 in the game in which Curry injured his foot — and that’s where his regular season ended.Curry was ready to go for the playoffs. So were the rest of the Warriors. They’re 12-4 in the playoffs, getting through Denver, Memphis and Dallas to get to the title round.“It all starts with Steph,” Kerr said. Udoka has a chance to become the 10th coach to win a title in his first season. Eddie Gottlieb (1947 Philadelphia Warriors), Buddy Jeanette (1948 Baltimore Bullets), John Kundla (1949 Minneapolis Lakers), George Senesky (1956 Philadelphia Warriors), Paul Westhead (1980 Los Angeles Lakers), Pat Riley (1982 Los Angeles Lakers), Tyronn Lue (2016 Cleveland Cavaliers) and Nick Nurse (2019 Toronto Raptors) are eight of the coaches who have pulled off the feat.The other name on that list is Kerr — who did it with Golden State in 2015, the start of this run of greatness from the Warriors. That was the beginning of six finals appearances in eight years, the two exceptions being when injuries and a roster reset kept them from the playoffs in 2020 and 2021.“You can’t take it for granted,” Curry said after the West title series. “Nothing’s ever guaranteed. We understand how hard it is to win. We’ve said that until we’re blue in the face the last two years. This is definitely special. Proud of everybody that is in that locker room, that came with it all year. Now we have an opportunity to go finish a job.”Udoka played for Popovich and later was a San Antonio assistant. Kerr played for the Spurs, then assisted Popovich with USA Basketball through last summer’s Tokyo Olympics — when the Americans won a fourth consecutive gold medal.The Warriors’ Draymond Green was on that Olympic team. So was Boston’s Jayson Tatum. They celebrated winning gold together, and now they’ll try to go through one another to get their fingerprints on the gold trophy that goes to the NBA champions — the Larry O’Brien.“This is an opportunity that players dream of,” Golden State’s Andrew Wiggins said. “To be put in a position to win it all.”And if nothing else, a Warriors-Celtics matchup made Green seem prophetic.After the Warriors won the West, Green visited the TNT broadcast set after the game and was prodded by Shaquille O’Neal to say which team from the then-undecided East title series that he would like to play.Green began giving a diplomatic answer, saying that both the Heat and Celtics were tough. O’Neal pressed him to be honest, and Green — never shy with words — gave in.“You’re asking me who I want to play. I’m gonna tell who I think we’re going to play: We’re going to play Boston,” Green said Thursday night. “That’s who we’re going to play.”He was right.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","Vanderbilt freshman Sargent wins NCAA title in playoff","96257082dd69bc1ebe5cfcab27096472","https://apnews.com/article/sports-oklahoma-texas-golf-96257082dd69bc1ebe5cfcab27096472","SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The wind whipped dust in the air, flags and balls all around the golf course. Combined with fast, tricky greens, birdies were hard to come by.Vanderbilt’s Gordon Sargent had one all day — and it was good enough to win a national championship.Sargent curled in a short birdie putt on the first hole of a four-man playoff on Monday to become the ninth freshman to win the NCAA individual title.“It definitely took a lot of patience out there — it was playing tough,” Sargent said. “There were people playing well, but I just stuck to my game, let it fall into place.”Sargent didn’t have a birdie during a 4-over 74 at Grayhawk Golf Club, but made the playoff when Oklahoma State’s Eugenio Lopez-Chacarra three-putted for bogey on the par-4 17th. Sargent hit a huge drive on 520-yard, par-4 18th in the playoff and put his second shot six feet below the hole.Texas senior Parker Coody chipped it close from short left of the green on his birdie try, and North Carolina senior Ryan Burnett missed a long birdie putt. After Lopez-Chacarra missed a par putt — he was well left of the green — the stage was set for Sargent.The Haskins Award finalist from Birmingham, Alabama, slipped the putt in on the left edge, sending a roar through the crowd and his teammates rushing onto the green in celebration. He is the first freshman to win the individual title since Southern California’s Jamie Lovemark in 2007. He’s also the second Vandy player to win an individual national title, with track and field’s Ryan Tolbert.The four players finished at even-par 280 on Grayhawk’s Raptor Course.“It was just a tough day and just had to manage expectations well,” Sargent said.Oklahoma senior Chris Gotterup missed two short birdie putts on the back nine and three-putted for bogey on No. 18 to miss the playoff by one.A day after Oklahoma’s Patrick Welch shot 63, gusty winds and fast greens gave players fits most of the afternoon. Coody and Burnett moved up the leaderboard by shooting even on a day when seven of 84 players shot under par.Sargent entered the final individual round with a one-shot lead over Gotterup after both shot 68 in Sunday’s third round.Sargent labored in the tough conditions through the front nine, finishing with three bogeys and no birdies. He still managed to tie for the lead at 1 under, but a bogey on the par-3 16th dropped him a shot behind Lopez-Chacarra. He parred the last two holes, tying for the lead when Lopez-Chacarra had a three-putt bogey at the 17th.Burnett, who started the final round four shots back at even par, had three birdies to make the turn at 1-under 34. He went to 1 over with bogeys on Nos. 11 and 15, but pulled into a tie for the lead with a birdie on No. 17.Coody started his final round on No. 10, four shots back, and made the turn in 2-over 37. The Texan reeled off three straight birdies starting on No. 3 to tie Sargent for the lead at 1 under, but closed with a bogey on the par-4 ninth to fall one back.Like Sargent, he ended up in the lead with Lopez-Chacarra’s bogey on 17.Lopez-Chacarra overcame a double bogey and a triple on Nos. 5-6 to tie Sargent for the lead with a short birdie on the par-4 15th. Lopez-Chacarra moved into the lead by one as the others faltered, but hit his tee shot on the short par-4 17th under a bush.He managed to chop it out, only to three-putt across the multi-tiered green, setting up the playoff.Vanderbilt, Oklahoma and North Carolina tied for the lead heading into Tuesday’s team match play. Texas, Oklahoma State, Pepperdine, Arizona State and Texas Tech also qualified for match play.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","Mountcastle, Urías back Wells as Orioles rout Red Sox 10-0","e39074eb764b08c005b36a3cee152d8b","https://apnews.com/article/mlb-sports-anthony-santander-tyler-wells-xander-bogaerts-e39074eb764b08c005b36a3cee152d8b","BOSTON (AP) — Tyler Wells pitched six smooth innings of two-hit ball and the Baltimore Orioles got early homers from Ryan Mountcastle and Ramón Urías in a 10-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday night.Anthony Santander sealed Baltimore’s third win in the five-game series with a three-run homer in the ninth. The Red Sox, who had won nine of 12 and taken their last four series, were shut out for the third time this season and finished with only four hits.Wells (2-4) struck out three and matched his career best by going six innings. He allowed only a single by Trevor Story in the second and Xander Bogaerts’ double in the fourth. Story also drew a walk in the fifth, but Wells didn’t allow another baserunner before being replaced by Dillon Tate in the seventh. “Wellsy set the tone for us, but we also swung the bat extremely well,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We haven’t had many games where we get a nice lead for a starter and allow him to kind of go for a while, and we did that tonight.”The Red Sox didn’t get their third hit until Christian Vázquez doubled in the eighth and reached third, but that was as close as Boston got to scoring. Red Sox veteran Rich Hill (2-2) was in trouble from the start after hitting Austin Hays with the third pitch of the night, then getting tagged by Trey Mancini for a triple when the ball took a funny bounce in left-center that caught Kiké Hernández by surprise. Mancini tried scoring when a pitch got through Vázquez, but Hill got home in time to cover and made a nice tag off a quick flip from the catcher. The play left the bases empty for Mountcastle, who drove a 3-2 pitch over the Green Monster for what would have been a two-run homer. Instead, the solo shot put the Orioles up 2-0. “It seems like that was sort of like the first time we really just put a team in the dirt a little bit early. It felt good to get out to a big lead and hopefully we can keep it going during the homestand,” said Mountcastle, who finished 4 for 5 to tie his season high for hits. Mountcastle singled in the third and scored when Urías homered to center. Hill was pulled in the fifth after a leadoff walk to Mancini and Mountcastle’s double down the left-field line. Hirokazu Sawamura inherited two runners in scoring position and nobody out and both scored, adding two more runs to Hill’s line and giving the Orioles a 6-0 lead. Hill entered having allowed four or fewer runs in his last 79 starts, a streak that dated back to May 2018. Hill threw 92 pitches in four-plus innings, allowing six earned runs on seven hits and two walks. He struck out five.Boston manager Alex Cora said Hill was having trouble locating his pitches early and his night unraveled from there.“I think from the get-go fastball command wasn’t there and the breaking ball didn’t play today,” Cora said.FRESH STARTHyde said Wells has been adapting well since moving over this season from long relief to starting. Wells also went six innings May 9 against Kansas City, which was his only previous win as a starter in the majors. “Being in Fenway, it’s always a lot of fun to play in because the energy is so good even if you are a rival,” Wells said. “The atmosphere right now in the clubhouse is great. It feels awesome to be able to take the series from them and being able to have a happy flight home.”OUCH!Plate umpire John Tumpane exited in the seventh after getting hit by a foul ball. Tumpane didn’t have a chance to move when Mountcastle fouled off a 96 mph fastball from Ryan Brasier and the ball deflected slightly, hitting Tumpane square in the protective face mask and knocking it off.Tumpane remained on his feet as a member of Boston’s athletic training staff came out of the dugout and spoke with him behind home plate. After a few minutes, Tumpane headed into the Red Sox dugout and went up the tunnel for further evaluation. The game resumed about 10 minutes later. First base ump Adrian Johnson moved behind the plate. TRAINER’S ROOMRed Sox: Placed LHP Matt Strahm on the COVID-19 injured list and recalled Sawamura from Triple-A Worcester. Strahm allowed four runs late in Friday night’s 12-8 loss to the Orioles, snapping a nine-game streak of scoreless relief appearances. Sawamura was just optioned to Worcester on Saturday and did not appear for the minor league club before being recalled. UP NEXTOrioles: Hyde said the Orioles plan to use a spot starter for a few innings Tuesday night when Baltimore opens a three-game series at home against the Mariners and RHP George Kirby (0-1, 4.50 ERA). Red Sox: RHP Michael Wacha (3-0, 2.83 ERA) is expected to start against Cincinnati RHP Luis Castillo (1-2, 4.35) in the opener of a two-game series . ___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

The American midfielder had a deal to join the Whites, but it was contingent on Premier League survival.“I’m sitting there sweating and pacing around the cafe,” he said of the May 22 match. “And, yeah, it was tough to watch, but they got the job done. ... And the next day I was there.”Aaronson’s contract was announced Friday, a five-year deal for the 21-year-old from Medford, New Jersey. He joined Red Bull Salzburg from Major League Soccer’s Philadelphia Union in January 2021 when Jesse Marsch was coach of the Austrian team, and he reunites with Marsch at Leeds.Aaronson had six goals and 10 assists in 41 matches in all competitions last season as Salbzurg won its ninth straight league title and fourth consecutive Austrian Cup. He has five goals in 18 international appearances and is on the U.S. roster for four World Cup prep matches next month.“I got a little, I guess, definition about the player that Leeds want, and I think I fit that,” he said. “They celebrate a tackle like a goal. And I’m going to be that guy that’s not only going to be the creative outlet ... I’m gong to be the guy that’s working hard, too, and that’s what Leeds is.”At the World Cup in November, the U.S. opens against Ukraine, Wales or Scotland, then plays England and Iran.“We’re going to the World Cup to win it,” Aaronson said. “We’re not just there as participants.”Notes: With Zack Steffen skipping the U.S. training camp, New England’s Matt Turner is likely to get starts. Turner transfers to Arsenal in July and projects as a backup to Aaron Ramsdale, similar to Steffen’s role behind Ederson at Manchester City. “I’ve been playing pretty well in MLS for the better part of three years now, and given the environment of transfers for goalkeepers in particular, this is the first real interest, first real offer that I’ve had,” Turner said. “Being a week-in, week-out starter in MLS didn’t guarantee me to be a starter here for the national team. ... I needed to shake things up in my club career.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

I was able to flush it and focus on the next AB and help the team.” Trailing 3-1 in the sixth, the Royals had a runner at first when Gonzalez made a nice play by tracking Salvador Perez’s slicing drive and making a catch in the right-field corner.After making the grab, Gonzalez nonchalantly threw the ball to a fan, convinced there were three outs. Upon realizing his mistake, Gonzalez crouched like a catcher and bit the top of his glove.“Honestly. I was like, ‘Oh, I screwed (up),’” Gonzalez said. “But my mind went to, ’I hope he hits to me and I can make the inning over.’”Andrew Benintendi was awarded two bases on Gonzalez’s mental error, but starter Zach Plesac, who pitched six solid innings, buckled down and struck out MJ Melendez to end the threat.Plesac didn’t feel the need to say anything to Gonzalez afterward.“Nothing came out of it so it was one of those, just kind of smile it off,” he said. “I’m not looking at him like, ‘Come on dude, you need to do better.’ He learned from it. He understood. He knew what he did. We got out of it with no runs, unscathed.”Ramírez hit his 13th homer — a two-run shot in the fifth — and raised his major league-leading total to 51 RBIs. He reached 50 RBIs in 44 games, the second fastest in team history behind Manny Ramirez, who did in 38 games in 1999.“He’s the best player in the game, hands down,” Plesac said. “I don’t care who wants to challenge him. He hits from both sides of the plate. He doesn’t strike out. He does his job and he puts up runs, so it’s phenomenal.”Nick Sandlin (4-2) got the win in relief.Emmanuel Rivera homered for the Royals, who rallied in the eighth but couldn’t stop from falling to 16-31 — the AL’s worst record. Before the game, Kansas City made roster moves involving eight players.Down 3-1, Kansas City tied it in the eighth on back-to-back RBI doubles by Whit Merrifield and Benintendi that tied it 3-3.But in Cleveland’s half, Josh Naylor drew a one-out walk off Snider, and Gonzalez singled to right before Giménez drove a 3-2 sinker from Snider over the wall in straightaway center for his fifth homer.The Guardians tacked on a fourth run on a throwing error by Royals rookie shortstop Bobby Witt Jr.“We got into a spot where we had to fight back and the guys did a great job with that late in the game against a good bullpen and gave us a chance,” Royals manager Mike Matheny said. “Unfortunately a one-out walk put us in a bit of a bind and then a pitch that wasn’t where we wanted it to be ended up being the home run.”MUSIC MANGonzalez’s choice for walk-up music raised some eyebrows.It the theme song from “SpongeBob SquarePants.”Why?“Because kids love that song and this is a kid’s game after all,” he said. “I’ve had it since Triple-A.” TRAINER’S ROOMRoyals: Veteran RHP Zack Greinke was placed on the 15-day IL with a strained right forearm, one of several roster roster moves before the series opener. The 38-year-old Greinke complained of tightness in his arm following Sunday’s start in Minnesota. Greinke’s 0-4 with a 5.05 ERA.Guardians: There’s still no timetable for DH Franmil Reyes (hamstring) to return from the injured list. He met with trainers, strength and conditioning coaches and Francona to map out a long-term plan. ... RHP Aaron Civale (strained gluteus) underwent another MRI after throwing a side session in anticipation of a scheduled rehab start at Triple-A Columbus Tuesday.

Syndergaard had Tommy John surgery on March 26, 2020, and didn’t return to the Mets until last Sept. 28, when he made the first of a pair of one-inning starts during the season’s final week.He became a free agent and agreed in November to a $21 million, one-year contract with the Angels. Syndergaard is 4-2 with a 3.08 ERA in seven starts, striking out 27 and walking eight over 38 innings.Syndergaard is averaging 94.67 mph with his fastball, down from 97.91 mph in 2019.Left-hander Jordan Montgomery (0-1, 3.30) pitches for the AL-leading Yankees as Mike Trout, Shohei Ohtani and the Angels try to stop a five-game skid. Ohtani is scheduled to start on the mound Thursday night in the series finale.STINGY STUFFTexas Rangers left-hander Martín Pérez is on a roll heading into his matchup with the Tampa Bay Rays. Pérez hasn’t allowed more than one earned run in any of his last seven starts and leads the majors with a 1.60 ERA. He hasn’t given up a homer all season.Pérez (3-2) lost his first two starts this year, giving up three earned runs each time. He’s permitted only four earned runs since for a 0.74 ERA over 48 1/3 innings.His stretch of 59 1/3 innings without yielding a homer is the longest active streak in the majors. That includes all 56 1/3 innings this year and the end of last season when pitching in relief for Boston. Pérez returned to his original big league team when he signed with the Rangers in free agency at the start of spring training.The last time Pérez started against the Rays, they hit three homers off him at home last July 30 in a 7-3 win over Boston. Randy Arozarena, Yandy Díaz and Mike Zunino went deep, and the lefty could face all of them again Tuesday night in Texas.HAPPY AT HOMEAdam Wainwright (5-4, 2.13 ERA) of the St. Louis Cardinals is 6-0 with a 1.73 ERA in eight starts and two relief appearances against San Diego during the regular season at Busch Stadium, never allowing a home run in 58 2/3 innings. Left-hander Blake Snell (0-2, 6.00) starts for the Padres.LET’S PLAY TWOThe Twins and Tigers play a day-night doubleheader in Detroit, but Minnesota star shortstop Carlos Correa will miss the entire series after testing positive for COVID-19.“He’s under the weather, but nothing above and beyond that,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “I think resting and hydrating are the most important things for him right now.”Minnesota outfielder Byron Buxton is 0 for 22 with seven strikeouts this season against Detroit.Kody Clemens, a son of seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, is likely to make his major league debut for the Tigers after they called him up Monday from Triple-A Toledo. The 26-year-old infielder/outfielder is expected to start in the second game, and Roger Clemens planned to be at Comerica Park.“He’s scrambling and trying to figure out when he’s going to fly here,” Kody Clemens said after Detroit’s 7-5 win Monday. “He loved it. He was like, `You’re a big leaguer, kid.’”A third-round pick in the 2018 amateur draft, Clemens was hitting .283 at Toledo with eight homers and 31 RBIs in 45 games.

Under the agreement, however, a pitcher who has pitched at least four consecutive innings in a game cannot be replaced on the active roster unless three days have elapsed.Graveman has two saves in five chances and has struck out 19 batters in 22 2-3 innings over 21 appearances. Drafted by Toronto in 2013, he debuted with the Blue Jays in 2014 before being traded to Oakland that offseason in the deal that sent Josh Donaldson north. Keuchel, 34, went 2-5 with a 7.88 ERA in eight starts before being designated for assignment on Saturday. Keuchel won the AL Cy Young Award with Houston in 2015 and has a 101-87 record with a 3.86 ERA in 262 career games, including 251 starts.The veteran left-hander signed a $55.5 million, three-year contract with the White Sox in December 2019. He’s owed $14,456,044 for the remainder of his contract — $12,956,044 in salary for the rest of this season, plus a $1.5 million buyout of his 2023 option.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

It reached the third deck concourse at Coors Field. “I hit it right there in the sweet spot,” Sánchez said through an interpreter. “The feeling was great, just incredible.”Garrett Hampson had a two-run triple, Brendan Rodgers singled in the bottom of the eighth inning to extend his career-long hitting streak to 17 games and Rockies first baseman Connor Joe reached base safely in his 26th straight game with a triple in the sixth inning. Feltner (1-1) went seven innings and allowing four hits while striking out six and walking one. But he didn’t let Sánchez’s towering drive — which landed on the party deck — get to him. “Sometimes pitchers have a tendency to get a little hesitant after things like that,” Feltner said. “I just wanted to be in attack mode still and stick with my game plan.”The big-picture approach won out in the end.“He was aggressive, right from the get-go with some good fastballs,” Rockies manager Bud Black said of Feltner. “I thought his breaking ball today was as sharp as I’ve seen it. He did great. He threw well. He deserved that.”Miami starter Pablo López kept the Rockies in check through six scoreless innings, and Cole Sulser (0-2) came on in relief to start the seventh. Rodgers drew a leadoff walk, then Sam Hilliard and Hampson singled to load the bases. Daza, batting for Brian Serven, lined a double into the left-field corner, clearing the bases and giving Colorado a 3-1 lead. “I was glad Bud Black put me in that situation, gave me that opportunity and I did my job,” said Daza, who finished with four RBIs after adding a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth. “It was a changeup. I think I was a little out front, but I was still thinking in the middle (of the field) and I think that approach helped me.”Steven Okert relieved Sulser and Charlie Blackmon added an RBI single to cap the Rockies’ four-run seventh. Colorado added three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning. UPPER-DECK DRIVESánchez’s homer is tied for the second-longest home run ever hit at Coors Field. Mike Piazza, then with the Dodgers, hit a 496-foot HR on Sept. 26, 1997. Giancarlo Stanton holds the record for the longest homer at Coors Field — a 504-foot drive for the Marlins on Aug. 6, 2016.NEAR MISSThe Rockies just missed scoring in the sixth inning on a towering drive by C.J. Cron that the wind pushed slightly into foul territory as it sailed above the foul pole. The call was confirmed by replay review.RIGHT AT HOMEThe Rockies are 15-11 at Coors Field, but 7-15 on the road.TRAINER’S ROOMMarlins: 3B Joey Wendle left the game in the top of the fourth inning after sliding safely into second base and experiencing right hamstring discomfort.

LOUIS (AP) — Fast-starting Nolan Gorman hit a go-ahead, two-run homer, rookie Andre Pallante got his first big league win in his 17th appearance and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the San Diego Padres 6-3 on Monday. Paul Goldschmidt, batting just behind Gorman in the No. 3 slot, also hit two-run homer for the Cardinals.Gorman, a 22-year-old who was the 19th overall pick in the 2018 amateur draft, made his major league debut on May 20 and hit his first home run Saturday off Milwaukee’s Adrian Houser. Gorman homered on a changeup from Nick Martinez (2-3) for a 2-1 lead in the third inning, had his second three-hit game and is batting .387.“You got to be able to adapt super quickly,” Gorman said. “There’s quick adjustments that have to be made. Part of my game is drive in runs and hit the ball hard and far. Big thing for me to do is get a big pitch to hit and do some damage.” He singled in the first but was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. He also walked.“He can put a little fear in that opposing side at any time,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “He can leave the yard.”Pallante, a 23-year-old right-hander, allowed one run and five hits over 3 1/3 innings with a career-high five strikeouts and no walks. He was the second of five pitchers in an all-bullpen game for the starting pitcher-short Cardinals.“It’s pretty cool,” Pallante said. “I’ve been pitching here for a while. It’s kind of worn off a little bit. My dream was always to pitch in the major leagues. Once I got comfortable doing that, the wins and that stuff falls to the wayside. I just want to keep pitching well.” Pallante gave his father baseballs from his first game and his first strikeout. The pitcher is keeping the ball from his first win.“I’ve learned a lot about how to be a reliever. I’ve had bad outings and I’ve had good outings,” he said. ”What I’ve been trying to learn is how to eliminate the bad outings. I’ve been learning from the experienced guys.”Goldschmidt hit his 11th home run of the season, a seventh-inning drive off Steven Wilson that was his fifth in seven games. Goldschmidt is batting .352 with a 21-game hitting streak and has reached base safely in a career-high 35 consecutive games, the longest streak in the major leagues this season.Goldschmidt has 32 RBIs in May, and 17 of his last 29 hits have been for extra bases (nine home runs and eight doubles).“Any time you help the team win, it’s a good thing,” Goldschmidt said. “I just try to keep doing my job. I just try to stay in the moment.”His 22 extra base hits this month tie him with Stan Musial (1954) and Albert Pujols (2009) for the most in any May in Cardinals history.Before the home run, Goldschmidt popped up to second in the fifth. During a pitching change in the sixth, Marmol teased him about it.“I was starting to think you’re not human,” Marmol recalled telling Goldschmidt. “He’s able to laugh. He has a complete and another level of confidence. What he’s doing right now is highly impressive.”Packy Naughton, recalled from Triple-A Memphis, started for the Cardinals and went 2 1/3 innings. He fell behind on a third-inning RBI single by Jurickson Profar, who had three hits.“We’re fighting to get hits, ” Padres manager Bob Melvin said. “We’re just not getting the big blow..”Giovanny Gallegos and Génesis Cabrera each pitched a scoreless inning, and Ryan Helsley got four outs, allowing Manny Machado’s RBI single in the ninth.“That was a huge job by our bullpen,” Goldschmidt said. “It was a great job by all those pitchers. We needed it.”Tommy Edman boosted the lead to 3-1 with an RBI single in the fifth, but Austin Nola’s run-scoring single cut the gap in the sixth.Yadier Molina added an RBI double in the three-run seventh.Martinez gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings.“I thought it went well for the most part,” Martinez said. “My stuff felt good. I felt like I was attacking the zone well. I’m not going to give in or give up.” MILESTONE WATCHAlbert Pujols played in the 2,997th game and is four from tying Cal Ripkin Jr. for eighth. Pujols needs two hits to match Paul Molitor for ninth at 3,319 ... Molina is one at-bat from tying Johnny Bench at 7,658 for fifth among primary catcher. CARDS, PADRES ON MEMORIAL DAY HOLIDAY The only prior time the Cardinals and Padres faced off on Memorial Day before was back in 1975 at Busch Stadium II. San Diego scored a 9-6 victory in a game that Bob Gibson started and Lou Brock recorded a double and stolen base. ROSTER MOVECardinals: Jake Woodford was optioned to Memphis.TRAINER’S ROOMPadres: 3B Machado was back in the starting lineup after missing two games with what the club described as the effects of tennis elbow in his right arm. ... RF Wil Meyers, who missed Sunday’s game with right knee inflammation, ran before the game. ... RHP Mike Clevinger (right triceps strain) is on track to rejoin the club during its June 2-5 series in Milwaukee. Cardinals: CF Harrison Bader was back in the Cardinals’ lineup Monday. He missed Sunday’s game against Milwaukee when he was ill. ... LF Tyler O’Neill (right shoulder impingement) is back to swinging the bat in the cage. His throwing program is progressing. O’Neill may begin a rehab assignment Tuesday. UP NEXTPaadres: LHP Blake Snell (0-2, 6.00) will be making his third start of the year. In his last start, he gave up three earned runs in 5 1/3 in a 4-1 loss to Milwaukee. Cardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright (5-4, 2.13) will be facing the Padres for the first time this season and 18th time. He is 6-0 with a 1.73 ERA in eight starts and two relief appearances against San Diego during the regular season at Busch Stadium, never allowing a home run in 58 2/3 innings. ___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
"2","Alvarez hits 2 long homers to lead Astros past A’s 5-1","95ca1915053e62472b7300f9e4715a52","https://apnews.com/article/mlb-sports-framber-valdez-jose-altuve-paul-blackburn-95ca1915053e62472b7300f9e4715a52","OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Yordan Álvarez might have been the only person unimpressed by his pair of tape-measure home runs.Álvarez hit a pair of no-doubt homers, Framber Valdez pitched a two-hitter for a rare complete game and the Houston Astros beat the Oakland Athletics 5-1 on Monday.After being held to five runs the previous four games, the Astros bats woke up against Oakland ace Paul Blackburn (5-1).Álvarez hit a 469-foot drive to give Houston its first run in the fourth against Blackburn and added a 444-foot shot to nearly the same spot in the eighth off A.J. Puk for his 14th homer of the season. “I didn’t know how far that was but I know it was way up there,” manager Dusty Baker said. “I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a ball hit up there. It was very impressive. He hit the second one too so hopefully he’s getting hot.”Álvarez said he believes he could hit it even farther than he did on his first shot and said he didn’t take the opportunity to admire it before running the bases.“Sometimes I would like to do that, but I also have to step on the bases so I would rather do that,” he said through an interpreter. Jose Altuve also went deep with a two-run homer in the fifth that was the 174th of his career, tied with George Springer for fifth most ever by a Houston player.That was more than enough support for Valdez (5-2), who threw just the seventh nine-inning complete game in the majors this season. He struck out seven, walked three and threw 114 pitches in the longest outing in his five-year big league career. His only other complete game was a six-inning performance in a doubleheader last season.“He wanted it and we didn’t think his health was in jeopardy,” Baker said. “So that’s why we sent him back out there, saving our bullpen.”Valdez, who won his fourth straight start, didn’t allow a hit until Kevin Smith’s clean double to left leading off the sixth. He had gotten help from a diving stop by Altuve at second base on a line drive by Elvis Andrus in the fifth.Ramon Laureano followed with an RBI single in the sixth for Oakland’s first run but couldn’t generate anything else. “Valdez is a bulldog,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. “That’s a bulldog right there. That guy, a really impressive day on his end. His breaking ball is really a weapon and he’s got 95 (mph) at pitch 112 in the ninth inning I think. Tough day for us offensively.”Blackburn had been even better than Valdez of late, coming into the game with a 1.70 ERA and allowing only one homer in 47 2/3 innings.That success didn’t continue against the Astros with Álvarez delivering a no-doubt shot halfway up the right-field stands that Laureano didn’t even turn to look at.Martín Maldonado added an RBI single in the fifth before Altuve’s homer as Blackburn allowed a season-high four runs in 6 2/3 innings. The A’s have lost seven of 10 and trail the Astros by 12 games in the AL West, their biggest deficit in the division since being 12 back on June 16, 2019. GO DEEPThe two long homers marked the 22nd time since 2015 that a player hit a pair of homers that traveled at least 440 feet in the same game, according to Sportradar. The last player to do it was Aaron Judge on Sept. 30, 2021, against Toronto.COLLISIONThere was a scary moment in the seventh inning when Altuve and Christian Bethancourt collided at first base. Altuve hit a grounder to third and Chad Pinder’s throw to first was high. Bethancourt leaped to try to make the catch and Altuve ran into him as he hit the base. Both players went down immediately and trainers for both teams rushed onto the field. Altuve was replaced on defense in the bottom of the eighth to be evaluated for a possible concussion after Baker said he “didn’t look too good in the eye.” TRAINER’S ROOMAstros: RF Kyle Tucker (left foot) sat out a second straight game and is day to day. Manager Dusty Baker said an MRI revealed Tucker has inflammation but no structural damage. Athletics: Smith bruised a knee making a diving catch in foul territory in the third inning and was replaced by pinch-runner Seth Brown after his double in the sixth. He is day to day.UP NEXTRHP Cristian Javier (3-2, 2.43) starts the middle game of the series for Houston against A’s RHP Frankie Montas (2-4, 3.28). Javier matched his career high with nine strikeouts in his last start against Cleveland last Wednesday. Montas is 0-3 in his last seven starts despite a 3.12 ERA in that span.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

He left the contest and has not played since.Suzuki is batting .245 with four homers and 21 RBIs in 41 games. The roster move was retroactive to Friday.The Cubs also designated veteran right-hander Robert Gsellman for assignment and selected the contract of left-hander Brandon Hughes from Triple-A Iowa.Gsellman is 0-2 with a 4.70 ERA in eight relief appearances, including a scoreless ninth inning in the first game.

People with legitimate tickets bought through Liverpool and UEFA reported struggling to access the stadium.“There was massive fraud at an industrial level and an organization of fake tickets because of the pre-filtering by the Stade de France and the French Football Federation, 70% of the tickets were fake tickets coming into the Stade de France,” Interior minister Gérald Darmanin said. “Fifteen percent of fake tickets also were after the first filtering ... more than 2,600 tickets were confirmed by UEFA as non-validated tickets even though they’d gone through the first filtering. The French sports ministry provided no evidence for its claims and it did not respond to a follow-up email after hosting a combative news conference.“A massive presence of these fake tickets of course was the issue why there were delays,” Darmanin said. “Three times the beginning of the match was delayed.”The final, which Liverpool lost 1-0 to Real Madrid, kicked off 37 minutes late. Liverpool chief executive Billy Hogan said it was “completely inappropriate” for the French authorities to be forming conclusions and commenting on numbers so early.“At this stage I think it’s just not responsible to be making comments before we’ve actually gathered all the information,” Hogan said. “How can (the number of fans without tickets) be quantified at this stage, before we’ve had an independent and transparent investigation? There’s also been quotes about people with fake tickets. But, again, how do we know all the facts until we’ve had an investigation?”Hogan said Liverpool was “reviewing legal avenues” on behalf of supporters.“The Champions League final should be one of the finest spectacles in football and it resulted in one of the worst experiences of many supporters’ lives. So, I would say that all politicians and agencies involved in this event need to wait until a full and independent investigation is concluded before attempting to shift blame.”Tear gas and pepper spray was targeted at Liverpool fans, impacting children — a tactic defended by Darmanin to prevent deaths.“I’d like to thank the forces of law and order, also those who worked in the stadium because they were very calm and they were able to avoid drama and so thank you for organizing the pre-filtering but lifting it when there was too much pressure to avoid a drama,” Darmanin said. “That was a decision made by the prefecture to avoid any kind of deaths or seriously injured.”French Sports minister Amélie Ouéda-Castéra blamed fans arriving at the stadium late for the crowd control issues, but did not say when they should have arrived at the stadium on the outskirts of Paris.“We have seen, we have to improve in risky matches certain aspects with regard to managing the flows, first filtering, second filtering, and we have to make sure we look at electronic ticketing as closely as possible so we can avoid fraud as far as ticketing is concerned,” Ouéda-Castéra said. “That is something which is absolutely essential.”Ouéda-Castéra did say supporters who couldn’t get into the stadium should be compensated, but ignored questions as she left the news conference where Ouéda-Castéra.“We are extremely sorry for all the people whose experience was wasted all that evening,” Ouéda-Castéra said. “For the people who had bought tickets and were unable to attend the match. That’s why we have asked UEFA to really work on a compensation system for those people — 2,700, including British people — so that they get compensation.”UEFA did not raise the issue of compensating fans in its statement about its own investigation.“Evidence will be gathered from all relevant parties and the findings of the independent report will be made public once completed,” UEFA said, without giving a timeline.French authorities will set up a working group to prevent violence in stadiums and target troublemakers after seeing a spate of incidents this season in domestic games.___AP Sports Writer Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

He was like `You’re a big leaguer, kid.″”Clemens was assigned No. 21, which hs father wore with Boston from 1984-96 and with Toronto for the following two seasons before switching to No. 22 with the New York Yankees and Houston.“Obviously, I’m trying to create my own career path here, but to wear his number is awesome,” Kody Clemens said. “Luckily, we always say that I’m glad I’m a hitter, not a pitcher, so I don″t have to live up to what he did. Half a career as his is unbelievable.”Detroit recalled the infielder/outfielder from Triple-A Toledo of the International League and put outfielder Robbie Grossman on the 10-day injured list because of a strained neck.Clemens is expected to start in the second game of Tuesday’s doubleheader against Minnesota, when right-hander Cole Sands is slated to be on the mound for the Twins.A third round pick in the 2018 amateur draft, Clemens was hitting .283 at Toledo with eight homers and 31 RBIs in 45 games. Drafted as a second baseman, he has played first, second, third and left this season.“As soon as we got A.J. (Hinch) a couple years back, he took me into his office and just said, `Hey, do you play anywhere else?’” Clemens said. “I was like, I really played a lot of third in college. I’ll play third base, outfield, wherever you want.”Detroit needed depth because of Grossman’s injury and Miguel Cabrera’s bad back. Roger Clemens was an 11-time All-Star who won 354 games in a major league career from 1984-2007 and struck out 4,672, third behind Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson.Among the players implicated in the 2007 Mitchell Report, Roger Clemens denied using performance-enhancing drugs. In 2012, he was acquitted of charges he lied to Congress when he denied allegations of PED use.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

He was removed from Sunday’s game at Oakland with tightness in his hip in the fifth inning. He hit his seventh homer earlier in the game, and his batting .228 with 23 RBIs in 41 games. Texas also recalled outfielder Zach Reks from Round Rock. Hard-throwing right-hander reliever Albert Abreu was designated for assignment. Smith and Reks were both in the starting lineup for the Rangers on Monday night in the opener of a four-game home series against the Tampa Bay Rays. Texas acquired Smith from the Yankees in the six-player trade last July that sent slugger Joey Gallo to New York. Smith was a second-round pick by the Yankees out of LSU in the 2019 amateur draft, and went into this season rated as one of the top 10 prospects for the Rangers.Smith hit .273 with four homers, eight doubles, two triples and 29 RBIs in 40 games at Round Rock. He has started 17 games at third base, 14 at shortstop and nine at center field. Reks hit .286 with three RBIs in six games in an earlier stint with the Rangers this season.

Benzema netted another four goals against Chelsea in the quarterfinals and three against Manchester City in the semifinals — including the decisive penalty in extra time of the second leg — before Madrid defeated Liverpool 1-0 in the final on Saturday. Benzema was also the top scorer in the Spanish league as Madrid won the title in dominant fashion. “There’s no doubt, its very clear that Benzema had a spectacular year,” Messi said in an interview to Argentine TV channel TyC Sports when asked if Benzema should get the prestigious award. “I think there is no doubt this year.”In total, Benzema scored 44 goals in 46 matches with his club this season, and equaled Madrid great Raúl González as the club’s second-highest scorer with 323 goals. Cristiano Ronaldo leads that tally with 451.While Madrid knocked out a quartet of European giants on their way to the Champions League title, Messi wasn’t overly impressed with the team’s style of play. Madrid needed big comebacks against both PSG and Man City and had Benzema to thank both times. “Out of the blue they score against you, and the match changes automatically,” Messi said about this Madrid team. “Madrid was not the best team in this Champions League, there were better teams.” The 34-year-old Messi is training with Argentina in Bilbao for the “Finalissima” — a friendly between the Copa America winners and European champion Italy on Wednesday.Messi could find himself going up against Benzema again at the World Cup in Qatar this year — both Argentina and France are among the main contenders — but insisted that defending champion France should be considered the favorite. “France is an impressive team, (four years) ago we said they could be candidates and they ended as winners. I believe the hit they took at the Euros (being eliminated by Switzerland) made them stronger,” Messi said. “(Argentina) can fight anyone and will make it hard for any rival. That doesn’t mean we are the favorites to be world champions or any of that. It means we will fight against anyone.” ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

He allowed five runs — all on three home runs — in four innings in a 7-3 loss to the Twins.Greinke is 0-4 with 5.05 ERA this season.“Any guy who has been around as long as he has, he kind of know what he feels and knows what most likely will work,” manager Mike Matheny said. “We’re just trying to get ahead of it right now, just looks like it’s going to take a little time.”A six-time All-Star, Greinke is in his second stint with the Royals, who signed him to a $13 million, one-year contract in March.

(AP) — After finishing one of the most dominant runs in Southeastern Conference history, Tennessee was selected the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA baseball tournament Monday.The Volunteers (53-7) won 31 of their first 32 games, swept the SEC regular-season and tournament titles and have the best pitching and batting statistics in the nation. They’ve been the consensus No. 1 team in the polls all but one week since March 28 and enter regionals having won eight straight and 12 of 13.“It’s really cool to win the SEC Tournament,” Vols slugger Drew Gilbert said, “but we have bigger goals in mind and know we still have a lot of baseball in front of us.”The 64-team tournament opens Friday in 16 regionals. Winners advance to eight best-of-three super regionals. Those winners move on to the College World Series in Omaha.The top eight national seeds are assured of hosting super regionals if they win their regionals.The national seeds following Tennessee: Stanford (41-14), Oregon State (44-15), Virginia Tech (41-12), Texas A&M (37-18), Miami (39-18), Oklahoma State (39-20) and East Carolina (42-18).Stanford, which won the Pac-12 regular-season and tournament titles, is a national seed for the first time since it was No. 2 in 2018. Oregon State gives the Pac-12 two of the top three seeds for the first time.Virginia Tech, which was picked second to last in the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Coastal Division, has its highest seed in program history and will be playing in a regional for the first time since 2013.Texas A&M won its last seven SEC series under first-year coach Jim Schlossnagle to lock up a national seed after not making the tournament last year.East Carolina will play in the tournament for a 32nd time. The Pirates hold the distinction of having made the most appearances without reaching a CWS.Seeds nine through 16: Texas (42-19), North Carolina (38-19), Southern Mississippi (43-16), Louisville (38-18-1), Florida (39-22), Auburn (37-19), Maryland (45-12) and Georgia Southern (40-18).The ACC and SEC had the most teams selected, with nine apiece. The Big 12 and Pac-12 each got five teams in, and the Sun Belt Conference has four teams in the field. Tennessee opens regional play against Alabama State (34-23). The other teams playing in Knoxville are Campbell (40-17) and Georgia Tech (34-22).The Vols’ surge to their best season in program history, so far, comes in coach Tony Vitello’s fifth season. First baseman Luc Lipcius, a graduate student playing his sixth season, was on the 2017 team under Dave Serrano that went 7-21 in SEC play.“When I came in here we weren’t expected to do much we were kind of the laughingstock of the SEC,” Lipcius said. “Coach V and the staff came in and did their thing. They recruit players and make them better. It’s really awesome to see it come full circle.”The last four teams picked for regionals were Florida State, Grand Canyon, Liberty and Mississippi. The first four out were North Carolina State, Old Dominion, Rutgers and Wofford.Selection committee chairman and Army athletic director Mike Buddie said Ole Miss got the nod over N.C. State because it performed a bit stronger in regular-season conference series.N.C. State and Ole Miss each won four of 10 conference series, but only one of the Wolfpack’s was against a team in the NCAA field (Georgia Tech) while the Rebels had series wins over LSU and Auburn.“That was a brutal one,” Buddie said. “When it comes down to the last three or four teams, you have to really split hairs. Baseball is a game played in series. We weren’t looking at one-game scenarios unless that was the only data point.”Other notes about the tournament:— Florida State has the longest consecutive streak with 44 straight appearances. Other notable consecutive streaks include Vanderbilt (16) and Florida (14). — Coppin State (24-28) and Hofstra (30-21) are making their first appearances. Air Force (30-27) is making its first since 1969.— The best regional storyline could be a day two meeting between Texas A&M and TCU in College Station.

His comments over what took place in recent months may have referred to contrasting claims about a contract extension offer from Bayern. The club said Lewandowski rejected its offer, while his agent, Pini Zahavi, said no offer was ever made. Lewandowski added: “I am aware the transfer will be the best solution for both parties. I believe that Bayern will not stop me (forcibly) just because it has the opportunity.”He was speaking in Warsaw ahead of Poland’s Nations League match against Wales on Wednesday.Sitting next to him, Poland coach Czeslaw Michniewicz said: “It looks today that Bayern will use this year of contract and Robert will have to stay. The sooner it is sorted out the better for Robert because he will have his head clear and will focus on the work.“I am sure that a new impulse in the form of a change of league and surroundings will have only good effects on Robert and he will be able to pursue his dreams.”The 33-year-old forward previously told Polish broadcaster Eleven Sports it would be “hard to know if I’ll still be playing for Bayern next season.”Zahavi and Barcelona have reportedly verbally agreed on a three-year deal but Bayern has been firm in its stance that the player is not for sale.Lewandowski’s comments — his strongest yet — were not well received in Munich, where both Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidžić and chief executive Oliver Kahn had already said he will fulfill his contract.“I can’t tell you why Robert chose this way,” Kahn told TV station Sport1 in response to Lewandowski’s latest comments. “Such statements like that in public don’t bring anyone any further. Robert was world footballer of the year twice in succession here. I think he should know what he has at Bayern.” Kahn was referring to Lewandowski winning the Best FIFA Men’s Player award in 2020 and 2021.Lewandowski scored 312 goals in 384 Bundesliga games for Bayern and former club Borussia Dortmund.He hit 35 goals in 34 appearances last season to become the Bundesliga’s leading scorer for the fifth season in a row, and the seventh time overall.He broke the old record for Bundesliga goals in a season with 41 last year.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

(AP) — Anthony DeMaio scored four first-half goals for his fifth hat trick in his last six games, Logan McNaney made 17 saves to be named the NCAA Tournament’s most outstanding player and top-seeded Maryland completed a perfect season by holding off Cornell 9-7 on Monday to win the men’s lacrosse title. Maryland (18-0) set an NCAA record for most wins in a season without a loss, becoming the first undefeated team since Virginia in 2006. The Terps are 33-1 in the last two seasons, with the lone loss coming in the 2021 championship against the Cavaliers. “All I wanted to do was see these kids not crying this year,” Maryland coach John Tillman said. “Last year to see the tears, I feel so bad for guys like Nick Grill or Jared Bernhardt and the all the seniors last year that didn’t get this chance. Our guys were focused all year long and I give them a lot of credit.”Maryland ended the first quarter on a 4-0 run, with three straight goals from DeMaio during a span of 2:09, and the Terps led 7-2 at halftime. Maryland scored two goals in 42 seconds to open the second half for a 9-2 lead, but the Terps went scoreless for the last 27 minutes as Cornell battled back. The Big Red scored four unanswered goals to get within 9-6 with 7:27 left in the fourth. John Piatelli, the nation’s scoring leader, scored with 35.3 seconds remaining to set a Cornell record with 66 goals, but Maryland won the faceoff before running out the clock. It’s Maryland’s fourth title in program history.Logan Wisnauskas had two goals and two assists to become the first Terp to record 100 points in a single season, breaking Bernhardt’s record of 99 last season.Cornell (14-5), the No. 7 seed, was looking for its first title since 1977 — in front of an announced crowd of 22,184.Ivy League freshman of the year CJ Kirst opened the scoring midway through the first quarter and he also scored early in the second for his 55th of the season. ___More AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"

Khan called off a planned, opened-ended rally and sit-in last week in Islamabad after personally leading thousands of his supporters during a march on Islamabad.The PCB had kept Multan as a back-up option and said Monday the three-match ODI series, which is part of the Cricket World Cup Super League, will now be played as per schedule on June 8, 10 and 12.Since the PCB is relaying the pitches at the National Stadium in Karachi and Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Multan is the only other venue available to host international matches.It will be the first time that Pakistan hosts international games during the summer and the PCB has planned to start the games at 4 p.m. local time. West Indies will arrive in Islamabad on June 6 and will travel to Multan on a charter flight the same day.The ODI series was postponed last year after West Indies played the three Twenty20s but was forced to go back home due to a COVID-19 outbreak in their camp.

We’ve all seen ‘Gladiator,’ right? So you kind of know what was taking part and happening there many, many years ago.”Might Stenson impart some gladiator spirit onto his team?“We got plenty. We got 12 of them,” he said, referring to the number of players that will be selected to his squad.The Marco Simone club will become the third venue in continental Europe to host the Ryder Cup after Valderrama in Spain (1997) and Le Golf National in France (2018).The club is owned and run by fashion designer Lavinia Biagiotti Cigna.“You can come here to watch the matches and spend a few extra days in Rome,” Stenson said. “It will be the ultimate Ryder Cup golfing experience.”Stenson and vice captains Thomas Bjorn and Edoardo Molinari — who was announced to the post Monday — spent hours inspecting the course under a baking sun.“It will be a great test. I think similar to what we had in Paris with the high banks on the side of the course,” Stenson said. “It’s going to be great viewing points for the spectators.”Stenson said he and his team are trying to tweak the course in favor of the European player’s strengths.“It’s going to be risk and reward golf where you have to hit the good shots in to get birdie,” he said. “And if you don’t hit those shots in we’re there to make sure you’re going to pay the price for it.”Bjorn admired the driveable par-4 16th and the downhill flow of 18, saying those holes “are going to be pivotal.”Molinari thought Stenson was joking when he offered him one of the vice captain jobs.“We’ve known each other for so many years and he’s always been a person who jokes a lot,” Molinari said. “For an Italian player, though, this is beyond any dream. When I started playing golf, I never thought I’d get to this point.”Molinari and his younger brother, Francesco, were part of the victorious European team at the 2010 Ryder Cup in Wales. The older Molinari will specialize in statistics and analytics for Stenson.“That he’s Italian is obviously an added bonus but that’s not why the main reason for why he’s sitting here,” Stenson said during a news conference when Molinari was introduced. “It’s for his skill set.”In terms of skills, though, Francesco Molinari has been more successful than his brother.In 2018, Francesco Molinari became the first European, and second player overall in the competition’s current format, to go 5-0 at a Ryder Cup by clinching the decisive point over Phil Mickelson. He missed last year’s loss to the U.S. at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin after struggling with back issues.This being Italy, Stenson was asked if Francesco Molinari figures in his plans, too.“If you’re looking at what Francesco did in Paris, certainly so,” Stenson said. “We haven’t started the qualification process yet and it’s a long ways to go. But all the players that played in the Ryder Cup in the past and the ones who are wanting to play in the future are obviously on our radar, and of course Francesco is one of them.”Stenson added that he and the European Tour plan to announce qualifying criteria and the number of wild cards to be awarded “within two to four weeks.” He wouldn’t really go into how a Saudi-funded league that has fractured the golfing community might affect team selections.“I got no idea. And I’m not going to speculate on that,” Stenson said. “That’s a question I will pass by to the tours and the decision makers there.”Stenson seemed more concerned with how to overcome an American team coming off the largest rout ever over Europe, 19-9 at Whistling Straits, behind a team that had youth, talent, hunger and a little attitude.“Looking at it statistically over time, Europe has been underdogs many times,” Stenson said. “But we’ve overcome that with great team spirit and playing for each other and really coming together, especially on the home matches with the home fans.“I get goose bumps just thinking about playing in front of the home crowd. ... To play here in front of passionate Italian fans is going to be spectacular.”___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports___Andrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampf"

The daily Superdeporte published audio recorded from a private dinner attended by the president and some businessmen in April.Among his comments, Murthy jokingly said he would kill player Carlos Soler if he leaves the club without a transfer. The club at the time said the audio was edited and taken out of context.But on Monday Murthy left as an employee after the comments that “regrettably affected the club’s relationship with fans, government authorities and the community.”“The board would like to clarify that the content of the leaked conversations between Anil Murthy and various third parties are the personal views of Anil Murthy and not of Valencia CF,” the club said. “The board hold the view that a change in leadership is required, in order to regain the trust of the fans and the community and put Valencia CF in a position for success.”Valencia fans have been fierce critics of Murthy and Singaporean owner Peter Lim, saying they treat the club only as a business.In Valencia’s final game of the season this month, thousands of fans protested outside the Mestalla Stadium, waving “Lim Go Home” signs and shouting for the Singapore businessman to sell the club. It looked like there were more fans outside Mestalla than inside watching Valencia beat Celta Vigo 2-0 in the Spanish league, where it finished in ninth place.Valencia said it appointed Sean Bai as acting director general. Bai has been with the club since 2018 and is currently the director of the team’s youth academy. Valencia said he will primarily oversee the team’s soccer operations.Valencia said it will immediately begin searching for a new president. In the meantime, Khojama Kalimuddin, a non-executive board director, will stand in as president of the board of directors to oversee the administration of the club.“The board would like to reiterate that Valencia CF are fully committed to achieving long-term growth and success, and to complete the construction of the new Mestalla Stadium,” the club said. “We look forward to working with fans, authorities and other relevant stakeholders to achieve these objectives.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni"

The school began selling beer and alcoholic seltzer this past season for men’s and women’s basketball games in Stegeman Coliseum and at baseball games at Foley Field and softball games.Brooks, though, says UGA wants to move slowly on alcohol sales. “That’s not even a discussion point right now,” Brooks said “We introduced it at Stegeman, Foley Field and softball and it’s been a slow roll out. We’re going to be very intentional about that. That’s just not on the agenda right now for Sanford.”Beer and wine have been for sale at football games since 2019 in some club areas that require pricey donations to the athletic program. Those who rent private suites can also stock them with alcohol that is delivered before games.Georgia became the 11th Southeastern Conference school to offer alcohol sales at athletic venues.Brooks said expanding alcohol sales across a a stadium that seats more than 90,000 is more complicated.“There’s a lot of elements into it, whether it’s the length of the game and the time, or the logistics of just doing it and preparing it,” Brooks said. “Look, we’re still learning as we grow, so we started with smaller venues, to where we can crawl, walk, run, so now we’re still monitoring the progress.”"

I think he went into the right dressing room.”As well as overseeing training from afar, McCullum was seen taking an active role by directing balls to a slip cordon for catching practice.Having only retired in 2019, he is coaching a test team for the first time and has already had a major influence on English cricket. The attack-minded New Zealand team that McCullum captained provided the template for England’s World Cup-winning team of 2019.England is hoping the same thing can happen in red-ball cricket.“It takes time to play in that kind of fashion,” batter Jonny Bairstow said. “We saw it with the white-ball side, how that transition took a little bit of time to adapt to it.“That’s the exciting part of it … the way Ben plays his red-ball cricket and Bazza (McCullum) played his red-ball and white-ball cricket, I’m sure there will be things that rub off within the environment over the next few weeks, months and years.”McCullum played 101 tests for New Zealand and was known for being an aggressive, expansive batter.He has spoken of wanting to rid England of what he described as a “fear of failure” and introducing a more relaxed environment. The team has only won one of its last 17 tests and is in last place in the World Championship standings.“He is someone I have always wanted to work with,” Bairstow said of McCullum, “someone who I played against and — growing up watching him — someone I was very intrigued by and looked up to in many ways because of the way he went about his cricket.“I’m very excited about the prospect of working with him, hopefully for a long period of time.”McCullum will have three days to get his ideas across to England’s players before the first of three tests against the Black Caps, the world champion in that format.“I know Brendon will have a clear vision of how he wants them to play the game,” Stead said. “Whether that happens instantly or not, I guess it always takes a bit of time to embed those things. I’m not sure his impact right now will be as much as you see in a year’s time.”___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

(AP) — The Coca-Cola 600 was many things — excruciatingly long, wildly unpredictable and perhaps above all else, immensely entertaining.It was, as William Byron described after getting caught up in a 12-car crash, “chaos out there.”In race that took five hours, 13 minutes to complete and included 18 cautions and 17 cars finishing in the garage in various states of disrepair, the first Next Gen race at Charlotte Motor Speedway left many shaking their heads over the events of the night. Denny Hamlin ultimately won the longest race in NASCAR history (619.5 miles) by beating Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch to the finish line by 0.014 seconds in double overtime.Things were so insane at one point that Fox Sports racing analyst and longtime Cup Series driver Clint Bowyer exclaimed, “This is the wildest and craziest 600 that has ever happened!”And he was right.Few cars escaped the race unscathed, with Kyle Larson, Kyle Busch and Bubba Wallace among the many who simply got sideways while racing alone and spun out, often times ending up harmlessly in the infield turf and drawing a yellow flag.Others weren’t as fortunate.Chris Buescher was involved in a scary wreck that saw his No. 17 Ford flip five times before landing on its hood. Safety crews had to carefully to flip his car over before Buescher could climb out of the vehicle. He walked away sore but relatively unscathed.“Thank you to everybody working for not slamming it back,” Buescher said. “It was nice to be able to get out. The blood is rushing to your head a little bit.”And that wasn’t even the craziest wreck of the night.Last weekend’s All-Star Race winner, Ryan Blaney, got too low on the apron at the bottom of the track on lap 192 and spun to the right, heading up the track where he collected 11 other cars in the melee and ended the night for Brad Keselowski, Wallace, Kurt Busch and Chase Elliott, whose mangled cars were taken behind the pit wall.The most costly wreck, at least for defending race champion Kyle Larson, came when Chase Briscoe crashed with two laps to go while trying to take the lead from him, setting up overtime and adding to the madness.Larson, who appeared on the verge of becoming the first driver to repeat as champion of the Coca-Cola 600 since Jimmie Johnson in 2005, then got caught up in a wreck a few minutes later when Austin Dillon raced up from behind and went four wide for the lead. Larson nipped Dillon, causing another multicar collision and extending the race even further.Hamlin somehow made it through the carnage without a nick and held off Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch on the second restart for the win.“The (Next Gen) car has less side force and less general downforce,” Hamlin said of all the wrecks. “In our old car you could kind of hang out. The right side was a billboard, it was flat, so it caught air. Any time you stick your hand out of the window, you could feel it. This one is all rounded. The moment it gets sideways, it just spins out. You don’t have as much aerodynamics that keeps the car planted to the track.”That was a point of frustration for Byron, a Charlotte native.“It’s chaos out there,” Byron said. “You can’t drive the car the slightest bit sideways or you’re wrecked. So, if somebody gets a little bit sideways, then we all wreck. It either takes out other people or they spin to the infield. Just chaos.”Cup veteran Kevin Harvick expected as much after seeing the uncertainty the Next Gen car has brought this season.“I’ve been to this race a lot and I knew that the way the mile-and-a-half races had gone this particular year that it was gonna be a war,” Harvick said. “There weren’t as many tire issues as I thought there were going to be, but it wound up just being spinouts because the cars would just become an incredibly big handful as you’d get toward the end of the run.”Harvick shook his head, adding “it was definitely interesting, to say the least.”More interesting than the often mundane 600-mile races here at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the past. In 2016, for instance, Martin Truex Jr. led 392 of 400 laps, repeatedly riding away from the pack in clean air. It was an impressive feat but didn’t push the entertainment meter.Sunday’s race, meanwhile, featured 31 lead changes involving 13 different drivers.“To me, that was the most fun Charlotte race I’ve ever ran,” Briscoe said. “The racetrack was awesome. You could run the fence. You could run the middle. You could run the bottom. You could throw sliders.”He offered high praise for the Next Gen car, too.“In the past it seemed like we kind of got single-filed out,” Briscoe said. “It was a lot of fun. I’d do another 600 miles for sure.”Hamlin acknowledged there is still a lot that teams needs to learn about the Next Gen car but said that will come in time.“Every time we change cars it takes like a significant amount of time to get it right,” Hamlin said. “This was a major overhaul of a car. Other than it had a steering wheel and four tires, there wasn’t much that was similar to the previous generation car. That car had been honed in for a long time. This one still has some work to do. We got to do some testing to try to fix it in some areas. But in the meantime, we’re still having some pretty good racing.”___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"

Madrid restored some of its pride after being rejected by Mbappé with a victory over Liverpool on Saturday, securing yet another Champions League title.A week earlier, the club was mired in disappointment and trying to understand why it was turned down by the young French star who had always said he dreamed about playing for Real Madrid.“Today Mbappé doesn’t exist,” Madrid club president Florentino Pérez said after the team’s 1-0 victory at the Stade de France. “Today it’s about Real Madrid’s celebrations. What happened with Mbappé is already in the past. It’s forgotten.”Pérez was loudly criticized after not being able to close the deal with the France forward, who had been free to sign a pre-contract with the club.Madrid and its fans were certain Mbappé would be joining the club, but he surprisingly announced a week before the Champions League final that he would be staying with PSG. The French club last year had turned down Madrid offers of nearly 200 million euros ($215 million) for the player.The shocked Madrid supporters didn’t hide their disappointment.The crowd gathering at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to watch Saturday’s final on a big screen mixed chants of support for the club with ones attacking Mbappé.On Sunday, at the club’s traditional Cibeles square celebration spot, team captain Marcelo was interrupted while addressing the tens of thousands of fans as they began singing derogatory chants about Mbappé.More attacks on Mbappé were heard later Sunday at the Bernabéu as the crowd welcomed the players home to celebrate the latest European title.Before the final, Madrid players had tried their best not to talk about Mbappé’s decision to reject the club, saying they wanted to stay focused on the match against Liverpool. The news about Mbappé had been attracting much of the attention in Spain, leaving the Champions League final to the side.Mbappé’s teammate on the French national team, Karim Benzema, had said it was not the time to talk about “small things” like the failed transfer. After the final, Benzema said he would have liked to play with Mbappé, but his decision to stay with PSG had to be respected.“We will still enjoy playing together in the national team. We are good friends, this will not affect our relationship,” Benzema said. “Everyone is allowed to make their own decision.
