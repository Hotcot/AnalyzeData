Police said they had acted after being ""exposed to violence by rioters"". The scenes, carried live on Al Jazeera, caused widespread outrage and scathing criticism of the police's actions.However, following a meeting with Israel's alternate prime minister Yair Lapid and eight Arab mayors on Sunday, the MP announced she was returning to the government.Ms Zoabia said doing so would help improve the needs of Israel's Arab community, and that local leaders had placed her ""under immense pressure"" to rejoin. Her return restores the government to 60 seats in the 120-seat parliament.Ms Zoabi was the second member to resign within weeks, after a member of the prime minister's own right-wing Yamina party quit, saying the coalition was ""harming... the Jewish identity"" of the state.The coalition was formed in order to bring together enough parties to oust long-term Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following a series on inconclusive elections. Mr Netanyahu has been leader of the opposition since then and has vowed to return to office.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, A 2018 BBC story on how one school is bridging the gap between Jews and Arabs.More on this storyIsraeli coalition government in crisis as MP quits3 days agoThe murderous crime wave sweeping Israel's Arabs13 August 2021Related TopicsIsraelNaftali Bennett"

It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine.""But Mr Biden also prefaced his remarks saying US policy toward Taiwan ""has not changed"", which a White House spokesman swiftly reiterated.The remarks in Tokyo were the second time in recent months Mr Biden has unequivocally stated the US would defend Taiwan if China attacked, in what has been seen as a change in tone.The US pursues a policy known as ""strategic ambiguity"" on the China-Taiwan issue, and previously has been vague on what it would do in such a situation.China and Taiwan: A really simple guideWhat is the 'One China' policy?It is constantly walking a diplomatic tightrope due to commitments to both China and Taiwan.It has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but sells arms to it as part of its Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself.At the same time, it maintains formal ties with China and also diplomatically acknowledges China's position that there is only one Chinese government, which is known as the One China policy. Mr Biden on Monday stressed that the US still supports this policy.China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin insisted ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory"" and there was no room for compromise.""The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are fundamentally different. To compare those two is absurd. We once again urge the US to abide by the One China principle.""China and Taiwan: The basicsWhy do China and Taiwan have poor relations? China and Taiwan were divided during a civil war in the 1940s, but Beijing insists the island will be reclaimed at some point, by force if necessaryHow is Taiwan governed? The island has its own constitution, democratically elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forcesWho recognises Taiwan? Only a few countries recognise Taiwan.

Here are the latest developments: Bombardment of Donbas region by Russia forces is intensifyingRussian reinforcements expected to hold positions north of KharkivRussia preparing to surround the key city of SeverodonetskRussia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, but Ukrainian forces retook large areas around Kyiv in early April after Russia abandoned its push towards the capital.Following the withdrawal from the north of Ukraine, Russia has refocused its efforts on taking control of the east and south of the country.The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia has likely suffered a similar death toll in the first three months of its Ukraine operation, to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan.It says a combination of factors have led to the high number of casualties, including poor tactics and limited air cover.Slow Russian advances continues in eastRussian officials have said its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. The focus of Russian forces in recent weeks has been around the city of Izyum and in the east towards Severodonetsk. Russian troops have taken control of Rubizhne and Popasna as they move to surround their target of Severodonetsk. To the north, however, Ukrainian forces have now pushed the majority of Russian forces away from Kharkiv, the country's second largest city. The ISW reports that Russian troops withdrawn from around Kharkiv are now being redeployed to the Donetsk region.

But strong resistance from Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv in the west and in Mariupol in the east significantly slowed Russian advances.Russia has now taken control of the port city of Mariupol, which its forces encircled at the start of March, after more than two months of fierce Ukrainian resistance.Several hundred Ukrainian troops who were holed up in the Azovstal metal works factory in the south of the city have now surrendered.To the west, Russia had aimed to take control of Odesa and cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea, but its forces were blocked by a staunch defence in Mykolaiv and forced back towards Kherson by a Ukrainian counteroffensive in March.In the Black Sea, Russia is continuing efforts to reinforce its troops on Snake Island. The roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky outpost is owned by Ukraine but was taken over by Russian forces in February.Analysis: Snake Island and battle for control in Black SeaBy David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Alison Trowsdale, Tural Ahmedzade, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk, Debie Loizou, Simon Martin and Prina Shah.About these mapsTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.

Severodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, has come under intense artillery and missile fire from Moscow's forces. On Sunday, local officials said Russian troops were repelled after trying to enter the city from four directions.It comes as the UN said the global number of displaced people has risen above 100 million for the first time. Officials said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed to the grim milestone. More than 14 million people are thought to have fled their homes since the war began on 24 February. The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said the announcement should serve as a wake up call for world leaders. ""The international response to people fleeing war in Ukraine has been overwhelmingly positive,"" Mr Grandi said. ""But ultimately humanitarian aid is a palliative, not a cure. ""To reverse this trend the only answer is peace and stability so that innocent people are not forced to gamble between acute danger at home or precarious flight or exile.""Meanwhile, Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai accused Moscow of adopting a ""scorched-earth approach"" in its efforts to capture the city of Severodonetsk. ""Every day they are trying to break the line of defence,"" Mr Gaidai said. ""They are simply systematically destroying the city. Everywhere is being shelled constantly.""The city of 100,000 people sits on a strategic position on the Donets River, with UK defence officials saying it has likely become one of Russia's ""immediate tactical priorities"". Mr Gaidai warned that Russian forces have destroyed all but one bridge across the Donets river and said that the city is at risk of being cut off.He also accused Russian tanks of firing on residential buildings during fighting in the city and of seeking to erase Severodonetsk ""from the face of the earth"". Ukraine's human right's ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said the city risks suffering the same fate as Mariupol - being surrounded and pounded into submission. ""The enemy threw all his forces to storm Severodonetsk, on the outskirts of which there are constant battles,"" Ms Denisova wrote. Analysis: Russian war effort shifts to Severodonetskby Jeremy Bowen in DonbasWe visited the Ukrainian front line yesterday and the main thrust of the Russian activities at the moment is at Severodonetsk. Kyiv's soldiers have told us it is largely surrounded and they are undoubtedly under pressure.They've taken serious casualties and a Ukrainian military source said one unit that went into combat with 240 men returned with 135 - the others killed, wounded or taken prisoner.The Russians have taken some territory - villages and little towns - but it's a very heavily defended area. They've been fighting around there since 2014 and there are concrete Ukrainian positions that are hard to overcome. A couple of days ago in Moscow, the ministry of defence said they would take the whole of the Luhansk region.If Vladimir Putin can seize the whole of Luhansk and then do something similar in Donetsk, he could then say to Russians: ""This is a victory guys.""It would be nothing like the victory he sought when all this started in February, but one he could declare anyway. The Ukrainian authorities are very anxious that doesn't happen.Elsewhere, at least seven civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in Sunday's bombardment of the Donetsk region, according to the Ukrainian army's Facebook page.Shelling and missile strikes continued to pound Kharkiv in the north, as well as Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia in the south, officials said.Meanwhile, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said that Russia has likely suffered a similar number of casualties in Ukraine as it did during the entirety of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It said ""a combination of poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes officials"" had contributed to the high figures.It is unclear exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in its invasion. Moscow, which says it launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, has not updated its official figures since March, when defence officials said some 1,351 troops had been killed.

"1","Ukraine war: The defiant Russians speaking out about the war","Ukraine war: The defiant Russians speaking out about the warBy Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, AndriivkaPublished4 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingRelated TopicsRussia-Ukraine warImage source, Getty ImagesTo Ukrainians it was clear from the very start of Russia's invasion that this was no ""special operation"" to liberate the Donbas region, as Vladimir Putin had declared. It was all-out war. But in Russia it's a crime to call it that.Dozens of people have already been prosecuted under the ""fake news"" law, as it's known. They face up to 15 years behind bars for challenging the official line on Russia's invasion or criticising the military.It's a dramatic increase in censorship in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has spent his two decades in power removing opponents, stifling free speech and silencing the independent media: a dismantling of democracy that is having devastating consequences here in Ukraine.Vladimir Kara-Murza tried to warn of the danger. ReutersThe whole world now sees what the Putin regime is doing to UkraineVladimir Kara-MurzaRussian opposition activist, now in custodyIn a speech in the US in March, the Russian opposition activist lambasted Western leaders for seeking constant ""resets"" in relations with Mr Putin, allowing their countries to act as havens for tainted money and looking the other way even as Russia became ever less free.""The whole world now sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine,"" Mr Kara-Murza told the Arizona House of Representatives, a fortnight into the war. ""The bombing of maternity wards and hospitals and schools. The war crimes. These are war crimes.""But in Russia uttering such words is also a crime now. A month after his speech, Mr Kara-Murza was picked up by police in Moscow and later charged with ""spreading false information"" about Russia's military. He's still in custody. The law he is accused of breaking was passed in March, soon after the invasion. And yet Ukrainian prosecutors have already registered more than 11,000 alleged war crimes. A Russian soldier has admitted in court to shooting a civilian. And the BBC has gathered its own evidence, including CCTV footage of the shooting of two civilians by Russian forces. Those returning to salvage what they can from the wreckage of Andriivka have more, powerful testimony. When Russia invaded Ukraine, many families fled Kyiv for nearby villages like this, thinking they would be safer away from the capital. Instead they spent weeks cowering in cold cellars as occupying soldiers drove tanks into their yards and dug trenches in their vegetable plots. After the Russians withdrew, in April, the village elder says the bodies of 13 residents were found here.""They had their hands tied behind their backs and had been shot in the head,"" says Anatoliy Kibukevych. He then names every one of the victims. The main road - the route taken by Russian tanks ordered to seize Kyiv - is lined with the rubble of homes: heaps of singed bricks with metal bedframes or pots and pans oddly marooned in the middle of them. Painted pleas that read ""Children!"" or ""People!"" on garden gates have been pierced by shrapnel.Image caption, Painted pleas in Andriivka: ""People live here"" (left) and ""People live here - kids""""Truth is the regime's main enemy,"" says Evgenia Kara-Murza, Vladimir's wife, from Washington DC, where she lives for safety reasons. ""That's why I believe this regime is using this law to crush all dissent in Russia and to scare people into silence,""  ""I'm sure Vladimir realised the risks were high. They have never been low for him,"" she says, with a reminder that her activist husband was poisoned twice in the past and nearly died. But he kept returning to Russia and speaking out. ""He believes there comes a moment where you can't be afraid anymore and need to show to other people that they shouldn't be either.""When the war in Ukraine started, Lilia Yapparova felt compelled to cover it. ""I couldn't sleep, because people started to die‚Ä¶ and I needed to be there,"" she told me in Kyiv, where for a while she was the only Russian reporter on the ground in Ukrainian-controlled areas. There are only three even now - all women from independent media outlets. It's a tiny contingent compared with the Russian state TV correspondents who stride through eastern Ukraine in military clothing, ""Z"" patches on their arms in support of Russian soldiers, talking about ""denazification"" and the ""liberation"" of cities like Mariupol. Ms Yapparova wanted to at least dent that solid wall of propaganda. BBCI can't hide facts, but am I going to jail for that?Lilia YapparovaRussian independent journalist""The only thing that matters for me right now is for the war to stop and for people from Russia to see what's really going on,"" she says. But that's a battle of its own, on top of the danger of working on Ukraine's frontlines. Meduza, the news site Ms Yapparova writes for, has been banned in Russia, like almost all independent outlets. Journalists and media have been labelled as ""foreign agents"" while Facebook and other social media are blocked. Meanwhile, state TV channels have all switched to wall-to-wall coverage of Russia's ""special operation"". ""For now we lost the war with propaganda,"" Ms Yapparova concedes, describing how even people she knows personally are absorbing the official line. She feels a sense of responsibility for that, although the odds were stacked impossibly against her. And now she knows that every word she writes from Ukraine - true stories about the shooting of civilians, mass graves, terrible destruction - is putting her at risk of prosecution for ""fake news"". ""I am ready for that. I am not covering my eyes. I see the law for what it is,"" the journalist says. ""But I couldn't allow myself not to be here."" It doesn't stop her worrying, though.""Constantly. It hurts sometimes to write because I can't hide facts, but am I going to jail for that? Anything can happen.""For Michael Nacke the danger is already real. The young journalist left Russia before the war, escaping an environment that became increasingly repressive.He is now a wanted man for telling the truth.""I used the word 'war' instead of 'special operation',"" he says of his ""crime"" as set-out by Russian investigators in a 91-page statement. ""It doesn't matter which law they use against you, it's just to make you shut up.""LISTEN: BBC's War on Truth podcastThe prosecution is based on an episode on his YouTube channel in which he discusses how Russian tanks fired on a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. The incident was widely condemned, including at an emergency session of the UN Security Council. But Moscow claims Ukrainian forces set the fire themselves so in Russia that makes reporting anything else illegal.""The one thing that I understand after this is that the work I do really matters,"" Mr Nacke says of the criminal case against him. ""I used to ask myself: 'Is my work effective to stop the war?' Now I see that it makes sense."" The risks and consequences of this war are far more severe for Ukrainians, as every shattered inch of Andriivka shows.""We've been through so much. Fear and horror,"" Alina Petrovna tells me, as her son nails tarpaulin over the holes left in their roof by the shockwaves of heavy shelling. The elderly lady lived in the family vegetable cellar for 29 days after Russian troops took over her village. She was terrified. Image caption, A team from the UN interviewing residents of Andriivka as they collect testimony of alleged war crimesThere are bullet holes in the front door where soldiers shot their way through to loot from them. The only thing they left untouched were her icons. ""Let the Russian people come and see what they did to us!"" Her eyes fill with angry tears. ""Fear and horror,"" she repeats.  But most in Russia will never even hear about such suffering. Because Vladimir Putin has not only launched a war on Russia's neighbour, he has declared a war on truth.

The Department for Agriculture said it was committed to planting more trees.Confor chief executive Stuart Goodall said growing wood locally can cut emissions. ""It means that the benefits of that tree planting are kept local as well,"" he said.""Planting productive forests creates additional employment and, because of the strength of the market for wood, we're seeing timber prices increasing significantly.""That's an opportunity for the farming community to gain some value from marginal land, as well as the jobs associated downstream.""Image caption, Confor chief executive Stuart Goodall says growing wood locally can cut emissionsIt is two years since the Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots announced a target of planting 18 million trees by 2030.  That requires an average of 900 hectares a year to be planted.  But figures show just 200 to 300 hectares are currently being afforested each year.  ""We have lots of spare land that isn't producing and isn't being used productively, and that could be used for forests,"" said Brian Murphy, chief executive of timber business Balcas.""Each hectare is perhaps absorbing 12 to 20 tonnes of carbon every year over the life of that and you can imagine that it is a lot of CO2 taken out of the atmosphere.  ""That will help Northern Ireland achieve some of its climate targets, and we have a lot to achieve.""'Need to triple what we're doing'Confor members are calling for more commercial planting as well planting for environmental purposes, which usually includes slower-growing native species like oak and ash.  ""Northern Ireland's typical land use is agriculture, forestry is a very good alternative land use but it's changing the perception and the mindset,"" said Ross Jamieson, of RJ Woodland Services Ltd.  ""We really need to triple what we're doing at the moment.  ""The ideal balance would be if we could maybe get about 75% commercial and 25% environmental, within every woodland.  ""Obviously every site has differences, and we need to be site specific, but that would be an ideal balance, and that would allow us to have our environmental, our native woodland that will grow on and remain for a long time and then we can also have our commercial element which will be on a shorter rotation.""Image caption, Ross Jamieson, of RJ Woodland Services Ltd, says NI has the capacity to grow more timber than is used hereThose commercial trees are species like conifers and sitka spruce.  ""Northern Ireland has the capability of growing much more timber that can be used in this country,"" Mr Jamieson said.  ""All you have to do is look around your own home or your farm and you'll see how much timber is used, from toilet paper to writing paper to fence posts, garden sheds.  ""The ground we really want to plant in Northern Ireland is the marginal, the upland ground that's not just completely environmentally sensitive but it's not the prime agricultural ground either.  ""We want to be hitting the middle ground and the financial incentive on that sort of ground is not as good as it could be.""A Department of Agriculture spokesman said: ""The minister remains completely committed to increasing forest cover in Northern Ireland in line with our long-term forestry strategy, to achieve 12% cover by 2050 and any suggestion otherwise is misleading. ""The minister brought an urgent focus to realising this over the next decade, though the Forests for our Future programme in 2020, where he committed to 9,000 hectares of new woodland over the 10 year period, in line with UK Committee for Climate Change recommendations. ""Since 2020, we've tripled the amount of new woodland meeting our targets in the first two years and are on track to achieving 95% of the target this year. ""We will set future years' targets in collaboration with delivering agricultural and environmental policies to help us achieve our ambitious long-term goals, and will continue to work alongside public sector organisations in order to maximise our forest cover.""Related TopicsClimate changeEnvironmentTree planting"

The decision six years ago was to turn him into an inventor of soluble products, including wet wipes.'I blew up my microwave'The 65-year-old from Kirkcaldy, who had spent more than two decades in coal mines and tunnels, found his first foray into the world of invention did not exactly go according to plan.""During my experiments, I managed to blow up my microwave, but I didn't give up,"" he explains at his home.Acknowledging his lack of chemistry skills, he was to seek and find an Ohio-based soluble paper specialist which developed, under his design patent, a stool collector that was flushable.His product was picked up by Swedish authorities, but turned down by the NHS in the UK on the grounds of cost.The setback might have put others off but it was to kick-start a series of inventions from Brian, who now has a suite of patents under his belt.His goal was deceptively simple - to design products that would dissolve almost instantly in water. This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, A demo from Brian's firm (with conventional wipe on the left) shows how the wipe dissolves And he has now signed significant deals with cosmetics and healthcare companies in the UK and beyond.""After a lot of hard work, I discovered I could venture into making a dissolving wipe - one that was wet that could do the job that needed done and dissolve,"" he says.""I could see an opportunity to make a wipe that was environmentally friendly. That was not easy. It must have taken me a year-and-a-half to get that perfect. ""Having worked in the fossil fuel industry, I went from one end to the other.""The wet wipes his company McCormack Innovation has since patented have been accredited with Water UK's ""Fine to Flush"" standard.Just recently, he signed a licensing agreement with an Australian cosmetics company for a range of products, including soluble make-up removal wipes.And has also has a contract with a UK-based firm to use his company's soluble wipe technology for the international stoma care market.Image source, Brian McCormackImage caption, Brian used to work as a coal miner and tunnel blasterBrian's inventions have piqued the interest of environmental groups and academics. WWF Scotland director Lang Banks says there's ""a huge global business opportunity awaiting anyone who can develop a genuinely sustainable alternative to plastic-containing wipes"".""Single-use wet wipes are a scourge on our environment, polluting our oceans and causing harm to marine life,"" he says.""That's why we need to see a rapid phase-out of unnecessary single-use plastics and single-use items that contain plastics.""In addition to a ban on wet wipes that contain plastic, we also need to see the development of environmentally-friendly alternatives."" 'Interesting concept'Marine ecologist Lea-Anne Henry, from the University of Edinburgh, describes the invention of soluble wipes as ""an interesting concept"", but has some reservations.  ""It's not clear what happens to the product once it dissolves. A flushed wet wipe may dissolve and disappear to our eyes, but if the product breaks down into micro- or nano-particles, as it sounds like it would, these particles will make their way through to our rivers and seas.""Scottish Water, which deals with 36,000 sewer blockages each year - 90% of which feature wet wipes - says ""any innovation in this area is of course welcomed, especially if it reduces the impact people's behaviours have on the planet"". However, it is still calling for a ban on the sale of wet wipes which contain plastic, and urging the public not to flush wipes of any kind down the toilet.Meanwhile, Brian's inventive abilities show no sign of waning.He is currently developing a range of dissolving wound care products in collaboration with the University of Dundee, after receiving a grant from the Scottish Funding Council.And he says the European Space Agency is currently testing his wipes for potential use in deep space.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brian hopes his wipes will be used in space""Thousands of wipes are used in space on the International Space Station, mostly in personal care,"" he explains. ""That waste is currently taken away from the station around every seven or eight weeks. ""But in deep space travel there is not the luxury of collecting or even jettisoning such refuse.""Brian, who left school at the age of 15 with no qualifications, finds it hard to explain where his inventive side came from.""I came from family of nine and became a fifth-generation coal miner. I remember my washing machine breaking down and I couldn't afford to get somebody to fix it - the shock absorber was away. But I fixed it with a bedspring - that's inventive, isn't it?""Image caption, Brian says his journey as an inventor has been hardAlthough Brian is beginning to reap the benefits of his inventions, he says his journey so far has been far from easy, due to the Covid pandemic.""When I started, there was a lot of focus on the environment, and that gave me momentum.""But then we had the pandemic. We couldn't get trialling, testing or meetings - people's focus was off the environment.""But I kept paddling in the background. It was a hard time.""Scottish Development International (SDI) has been helping Brian's company access markets overseas.Commenting on his deal with Conserving Beauty, SDI trade specialist Ashraf Mabrouk said: ""This is the latest exciting step for McCormack Innovation as the company aims to achieve its global ambitions.""The agility and determination Brian has showed to develop his idea, turn this into a feasible product and then take his business to market has been inspirational.""More on this storySoluble wet wipe quest aims to cause a stir4 hours agoCall for ban on wet wipes containing plastic23 FebruaryWet wipes to get 'Fine to Flush' logo11 January 2019Related TopicsUniversity of DundeeCosmeticsHealthcareWorld Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF)Bowel cancerInventionsInternational Space StationUniversity of EdinburghCoal miningKirkcaldy"

Amsterdam has been six metres underwater for ages and that's a really nice place."" Mr Kirk did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.Since the speech, senior HSBC executives have spoken out about the comments.In a LinkedIn post on Saturday, the bank's group chief executive Noel Quinn said he did not agree ""at all"" with Mr Kirk's remarks. ""They are inconsistent with HSBC's strategy and do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC or HSBC Asset Management,"" he said.Nuno Matos, chief executive of wealth and personal banking at HSBC, said that he was ""in complete agreement"" with Mr Quinn and that ""the transition to net zero is of utmost importance to us"".On Monday, HSBC declined to comment to the BBC on reports that Mr Kirk had been suspended.Instead, a spokesperson shared a statement by HSBC Asset Management chief executive Nicolas Moreau referring to climate change as ""one of the most serious emergencies facing the planet"".""HSBC Asset Management is committed to driving the transition to a sustainable global economy and has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure its clients' monies are managed for positive long-term environmental and social outcomes,"" Mr Moreau added.However, both the theme and content of the presentation had been approved within the company, according to the FT.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, How can I deal with my eco-anxiety?More on this storyBig banks fund new oil despite net zero pledges14 FebruaryHSBC fined ¬£64m for anti-money laundering failings17 December 2021Banks fined over collusion in currency trading2 December 2021Related TopicsCompaniesHSBCClimate changeEnvironment"

But structurally, Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai hasn't changed that much. The Tonga eruption produced the biggest atmospheric explosion recorded on Earth in more than a century.It generated tsunamis across the Pacific and in other ocean basins around the world. It even lifted the clouds over the UK, 16,500km away. Mercifully, only a handful of people lost their lives in the kingdom of Tonga.New Zealand's National Institute for Water and Atmospheric (NIWA) Research has now managed to get in close with a ship to map the post-eruption shape of Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai (HTHH) and of the surrounding seafloor.Professor snorkels over Tonga volcanoTonga eruption was 'record atmospheric explosion'Robot boat to map Tonga volcano aftermathThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Weather satellites captured the climactic eruption. Video looped three times. (Himawari-8/JMA/NCEO/@simon_sat)Although there's clearly been a lot of ash deposition and movement of sediment, the volcano continues to stand tall.The expedition leader, NIWA marine geologist Kevin Mackay, said he was taken aback by what he'd seen in the Research Vessel (RV) Tangaroa's sonar data.""Given the violence of the eruption on 15 January, I'd expected the edifice to either have collapsed or been blown apart, and this is not the case,"" he explained. ""While the volcano appeared intact, the seafloor showed some dramatic effects of the eruption. There is fine sandy mud and deep ash ripples as far as 50km away from the volcano, with gouged valleys and huge piles of sediment.""Image source, NIWA-Nippon Foundation/R.Parsons-KingImage caption, The Tangaroa in front of the two parts of the caldera rim that sit above the ocean surfaceFrom its 22,000-sq-km survey, the Tangaroa team calculates that about 6 to 7 cubic km of material have been added to the seafloor.This is ash and rock that was initially ejected by the volcano into the air but which then fell back down into the water and descended the flanks of the submarine mountain to run out over the ocean bottom. These density, or pyroclastic, flows were the major factor in generating the tsunami waves that inundated local islands, Mr Mackay told BBC News. Image source, NIWA-Nippon Foundation/R.Parsons-KingImage caption, The volcano and surrounding seafloor was last mapped in 2016The 1.8km-high HTHH was last surveyed in 2016. Combining the previous data with Tangaroa's new information has allowed scientists to make a ""difference map"".The deposition of all the new material is marked in red (see top image). Blue indicates where material has been lost. This is mostly from around the neck of the volcano. The researchers say 2 to 3 cubic km has come away from the upper portions of HTHH.In addition to the sonar survey, the Tangaroa's crew also studied the local ocean ecosystem.Image source, NIWA-Nippon Foundation TESMaPImage caption, On seamounts to the south of HTHH, sealife continues to flourishUnsurprisingly, the flanks of the volcano are now devoid of biology, but the team only had to travel about 15km to find fish and mussels thriving on other seamounts.""Both of these examples imply a resilience of animal populations in the region,"" said NIWA fisheries expert Dr Malcolm Clark. ""And this is important because it can give insights into how the eruption can affect the surrounding sealife and what the possible chances of recovery might be.""The researchers also tested the water column for physical and chemical characteristics, including temperature, nutrients and oxygen concentration. In places, the ash-fall has had a fertilisation effect and triggered plankton blooms. But the flip side is that researchers could identify, too, zones where oxygen in the water has become depleted.Image source, NIWA-Nippon Foundation/R.Parsons-KingImage caption, The team has a big collection of samples for further studyThe team took thousands of pictures and collected hundreds of samples during the cruise, including 115 sediment cores and 250kg of rock, some of which was newly formed in the eruption.The RV Tangaroa did not survey directly over Hunga-Tonga's opening, or caldera.This will be left to a robot boat developed by the UK company Sea-Kit International. The 12m uncrewed surface vessel, called Maxlimer, is currently in Singapore en route to Tongatapu, the main island in the Tongan archipelago.Because the boat can be controlled at a distance, it will be permitted to operate for extended periods over the caldera. The caution is warranted because the volcano appears still to be active. NIWA marine ecologist Dr Sarah Seabrook said this was evident from a persistent ash layer near the volcano at a depth of about 200m.""Our initial analyses on the origin of the ash layer suggest that it is not a remnant of the January eruption, but may instead show the volcano is still venting. That is, it's actively releasing volcanic ash, albeit on a far smaller scale,"" she explained.

A naval ship that sailed across the caldera recently found the depth of water over the caldera had increased dramatically. Pre-eruption there was only 150-200m of seawater. Post-eruption there is now 800m or more of water. HTHH's magma chamber was hollowed out.""Maxlimer definitely has the ability to measure that deep,"" said Mr Mackay.

His quirky TikTok videos about news, history, and politics have earned him more than 150,000 followers. In the video in question, recorded in October 2021, he decided it was time for a confession.""I am a climate doomer,"" he said. ""Since about 2019, I have believed that there's little to nothing that we can do to actually reverse climate change on a global scale.""Climate doomism is the idea that we are past the point of being able to do anything at all about global warming - and that mankind is highly likely to become extinct.That's wrong, scientists say, but the argument is picking up steam online.Image source, Charles McBryde/TikTokImage caption, ""I am a climate doomer,"" Charles McBryde told his TikTok followers last October'Give me hope'Charles admitted to feeling overwhelmed, anxious and depressed about global warming, but he followed up with a plea.

On TikTok she's known as thegarbagequeen.After watching Charles' video, she posted a reply, explaining in simple terms why he was wrong.Alaina makes a habit of challenging climate doomism - a mission she has embraced with a sense of urgency. ""People are giving up on activism because they're like, 'I can't handle it any more... This is too much...' and 'If it really is too late, why am I even trying?'"" she says.

""It doesn't mean the world is going to end - but we have to adapt, and we have to stop emitting.""Image source, ReutersFertile groundLast year, the Pew Research Center in the US ran a poll covering 17 countries, focusing on attitudes towards climate change.An overwhelming majority of the respondents said they were willing to change the way they lived to tackle the problem.But when asked how confident they were that climate action would significantly reduce the effects of global warming, more than half said they had little to no confidence.Doomism taps into, and exaggerates, that sense of hopelessness.

"4","The sci-fi technology tackling malarial mosquitos","The sci-fi technology tackling malarial mosquitosBy Richard Baimbridge and Will SmaleBusiness reportersPublished10 hours agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Target MalariaImage caption, Research group Target Malaria is testing gene drives on malarial mosquitos in laboratoriesEnvironmental campaigner Liz O'Neill doesn't mince her words about gene drives - the next generation of genetic modification (GM) technology.""It is extremely worrying,"" says the director of UK anti-GM pressure group, GM Freeze. ""To release something that has been specifically created in a laboratory in order to outfight nature, and spread without exception within wild populations, is extraordinary arrogant.""And once the genie is out of the bottle, you cannot put it back in.""Image source, Liz O'NeillImage caption, Anti-GM campaigner Liz O'Neill is concerned that gene drives could go wrong if used in the wildThe way gene drives work sounds like something from a science fiction novel, but they are already being used in laboratory tests. It is complicated stuff, but here is a simple explanation. While standard GM introduces a new, lab-tweaked gene into a organism, gene drive technology goes one stage further. It introduces a gene drive - a lab-created gene that can also automatically replicate itself - that targets and removes a specific natural gene.This is how it works: if an animal (parent A) that contains a gene drive mates with one that doesn't (parent B), then in the forming embryo that starts to combine their genetic material, parent A's gene drive immediately gets to work.It recognises the natural gene version of itself in the opposite chromosome from parent B, and destroys it, by cutting it out of the DNA chain. Parent B's chromosome then repairs itself - but does so, by copying parent A's gene drive.So, the embryo, and the resulting offspring, are all but guaranteed to have the gene drive, rather than a 50% chance with standard GM - because an embryo takes half its genes from each parent.Genetic scissors Gene drives are created by adding something called  Crispr, a programmable DNA sequence, to a gene. This tells it to target the natural version of itself in the DNA of the other parent in the new embryo. The gene drive also contains an enzyme that does the actual cutting. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gene drives are able to cut another gene out of a strip of DNASo, what is the point of such complex technology? It is hoped that gene drives can be used to greatly reduce the numbers of malarial mosquitos, and other pests or invasive species. This process is more effective than standard DNA because as every single offspring has the introduced gene trait it spreads much faster and further.One organisation at the forefront of this is Target Malaria, which has developed gene drives that stop mosquitos from producing female offspring. This is important for two reasons - only the females bite, and without females, mosquito numbers will plummet.The core aim is to greatly reduce the number of people who die from malaria - of which there were sadly 627,000 in 2020, according to the World Health Organization. It could also slash the economic impact of the disease. With 241 million cases in 2020, mostly in Africa, malaria is estimated to cost the continent $12bn (¬£9.7bn) in reduced economic output every year.The financial effect of invasive species - everything from cane toads, to lionfish, brown snakes, fruit flies, zebra muscles, and Japanese knotweed - is even higher.  They cost the US and Canada $26bn (¬£21bn) a year, according to the US Department of Agriculture's National Invasive Species Information Center. Globally, it puts the impact at $1.29tn over the past 50 years.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The economic impact of malaria is significant and wide-ranging involving absenteeism from work and schoolYet, campaigners like Liz O'Neill say that the risks of unforeseen consequences, such as the gene drive leading to harmful and unforeseen mutations and knock-on effects, are too high.""Gene drives are GM on steroids supercharged,"" she says. ""Every concern one would have about the use of any genetic modification is exponentially more worrying when talking about gene drives because of how far and wide they are designed to spread.""New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.However, while the technology has not yet been authorised for use in the wild, there are no bans against continuing laboratory research into it. After serious debate in 2018, the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity ruled that this may continue.Dr Jonathan Kayondo is a principal investigator for Target Malaria in Uganda. He points out that natural gene drives already exist - dominate or ""selfish genes"" that override weaker ones. He also stresses that in continuing to develop engineered gene drives safety remains the core concern.""Malaria is one of the oldest diseases on the planet, and despite decades of efforts, a child still dies of malaria every minute,"" he says.Image source, Target MalariaImage caption, Target Malaria's Dr Jonathan Kayondo says that safety is paramount to its continuing gene drive tests""Innovative approaches are urgently needed as both the malaria mosquito and the malaria parasite are becoming increasingly resistant to current methods.  Gene drive approaches could be part of an integrated approach to combat malaria, complementing existing interventions.""Dr Kayondo adds that Target Malaria is continuing to test gene drives on mosquitos at Imperial College in London, and at Italian research firm, Polo GGB.He adds: ""The project is proceeding step-by-step, and at each phase the safety of the technology is being evaluated.""External scientific advice and independent external risk assessment are being sought for each stage and phase of the research, and the project will not proceed further if evidence of a concern about human, animal health or environmental safety makes the technology unacceptable to participating communities and national governments.""One of the world's pioneering developers of gene drives is US biologist Kevin Esvelt, an assistant professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He first came up with the technology back in 2013.Image source, Kevin EsveltImage caption, Prof Esvelt has been at the forefront of gene drive developmentProf Esvelt says that safety is the main concern, and it is being built into the latest gene drive technology.""Given the potential for gene drives to alter entire wild populations and therefore ecosystems, the development of this technology must include robust safeguards and methods of control,"" he says.Prof Esvelt adds that this technology is being provided by something called ""daisy chain"". This is where a gene drive is designed to become inert after a few generations. Or halving its spread every generation until it eventually stops.Using this technology he says it is possible to control and isolate the spread of gene drives.""A town could release GM organisms with its boundaries to alter the local population [of a particular organism] while minimally affecting the town next door,"" he says.Related TopicsGenetically modified animalsInvasive speciesMosquitoesMalariaGenetic engineering"

"3","Canada to ban China's Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networks","Canada to ban China's Huawei and ZTE from its 5G networksBy Annabelle  LiangBusiness reporterPublished2 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesCanada says it will ban two of China's biggest telecoms equipment makers from working on its 5G phone networks.The restrictions against Huawei and ZTE were announced by the country's industry minister on Thursday.Francois-Philippe Champagne says the move will improve Canada's mobile internet services and ""protect the safety and security of Canadians"".But Huawei Canada said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision, which it said was ""political"".""This is an unfortunate political decision that has nothing to do with cyber security or any of the technologies in question,"" a statement said.Several nations - including the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand - have already put restrictions on the firms.The four countries, along with Canada, make up an intelligence-sharing arrangement named ""Five Eyes"". It evolved during the Cold War as a mechanism for monitoring the Soviet Union and sharing classified information.Canada's announcement was widely expected, as its allies had already barred Huawei and ZTE from their own high-speed networks. Speaking to reporters in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Mr Champagne said the decision came after ""a full review by our security agencies and consultation with our closest allies"".""Let me be very clear: We will always protect the safety and security of Canadians and will take any actions necessary to safeguard our telecommunication infrastructure,"" he added.""In a 5G world, at a time where we rely more and more in our daily lives [on] our network, this is the right decision.""A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Ottawa told the Reuters news agency that Beijing sees the security concerns raised by Canada as a ""pretext for political manipulation"".The spokesperson for China also accused Canada of working with the US to suppress Chinese companies.The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.Huawei Canada said its equipment had been ""closely scrutinised"" by the government and security agencies, and added there had been ""zero security incidents caused by Huawei equipment"".""Banning Huawei's equipment and services will lead to significant economic loss in Canada and drive up the cost of communications for Canadian consumers,"" a statement said.""Unfortunately, this decision is beyond our control as a business. However, we will do everything in our capacity to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our customers, partners, and ourselves.""Huawei board members resign over stance on UkraineUS bans Chinese telecom giant over spying concernsMeanwhile, ZTE said it rejected the ""premise"" of the Canadian government's announcement, saying it was ""highly speculative"".""We have always abided by international standards and best practices, opening up our cyber security labs to enable regulators and stakeholders to verify the security of ZTE products,"" the firm said.5G, or fifth generation, is the next upgrade to mobile internet networks, offering much faster data download and upload speeds.It also allows more devices to simultaneously access the internet.It comes as data usage is soaring, as the popularity of video and music streaming grows. This is pushing governments and mobile phone network operators to improve their telecommunications infrastructures.The Canadian government's decision means that telecoms firms in country will no longer be allowed to use equipment made by Huawei and ZTE. Companies that have already installed the equipment made by the Chinese manufacturers must now remove it, Mr Champagne said. Canada first announced a review of Huawei equipment in September 2018.Some of China's biggest technology and telecoms firms have been targeted in recent years by governments in the US and other Western nations over national security concerns.In November, US President Joe Biden signed legislation that stops companies judged to be security threats from receiving new telecoms equipment licences in the country.It means equipment from Huawei, ZTE and three other Chinese companies are banned for use in US telecoms networks.You may also be interested in:This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Chip wars: The US v ChinaMore on this storyHuawei board members resign over stance on Ukraine9 MarchUS bans Chinese telecom giant over spying concerns28 JanuaryBiden tightens restrictions on Huawei and ZTE12 November 2021Top Huawei boss flies back to China after deal with US25 September 2021Related TopicsChinaHuawei5GCanada"

The Office for National Statistics said off-licences saw a boost in sales last month, which it suggested meant people were staying in to save money. Danni Hewson, a financial analyst for AJ Bell, said the ""big uptick"" in food and drink spending in supermarkets ""might indicate that people are choosing their kitchen tables over pubs and restaurants as they look to save money"".""Whilst food spend has been largely unchanged, which suggests people are still being cautious, spend on alcohol and tobacco has soared,"" she added.""Life's little luxuries... will have to come in under budget as those budgets are tested.""M&S warns online sales tax will damage High StreetEnergy bills push price rises to 40-year highExperts had expected sales in April to fall further as consumers cut back in the face of rising living costs. Earlier this week, the latest official figures showed inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9% in the 12 months to April - the highest rate for 40 years.April saw the first impact of the latest jump in energy costs, with millions of people facing an unprecedented ¬£700-a-year increase in bills.However, prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, while wages have been failing to keep pace. The rate of inflation is expected to continue to rise this year.The ONS has previously said that people had begun to cut back on spending and use their cars less due to record petrol and diesel prices.Over the three months to the end of April, sales overall edged down by 0.3%, which revealed a longer downward trend, the ONS said.However, while sales volumes at non-food stores were down in April, online sales rose by 3.7% and the proportion of retail sales online remained substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, said Heather Bovill of the ONS.""Clothing sales had a strong month especially online, with some retailers suggesting consumers were purchasing clothes for summer holidays and weddings,"" she said.AJ Bell's Ms Hewson said summer would be the time for ""postponed events and much anticipated holidays"".""After a couple of years where only the top half was visible to most of the world people are updating their wardrobes,"" she added.But she warned the boost might be short-lived, saying: ""People can only spend a pound once and when that pound is worth significantly less than a year ago people have to make choices.""Surveys also suggest consumer confidence has taken a hit. The long-running GfK consumer confidence index fell by two points in May to -40, the lowest score since the survey began in 1974.GfK's Joe Staton said May's result was one point lower than the previous record set in July 2008.""This means consumer confidence is now weaker than in the darkest days of the global banking crisis, the impact of Brexit on the economy, or the Covid shutdown,"" he said.Image source, Getty ImagesHowever, Nicholas Farr, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said April's rise in retail sales suggested the higher cost of living had not caused consumer spending to collapse and meant ""the economy may have a little more momentum than we thought"".He added that rising inflation could not be solved without the Bank of England having to increase interest rates further.The Bank's response to rising prices has been to raise interest rates to try and cool them. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand.However, it has has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Bank governor Andrew Bailey defended its response, insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do.More on this storyPressure builds on Sunak to act now on living costs3 days agoM&S warns online sales tax will damage High Street4 days agoEnergy bills push price rises to 40-year high4 days agoShoppers watching every penny, says Sainsbury's28 AprilView commentsRelated TopicsRetailingInflationUK economyOffice for National Statistics"

The body had been asking for a change in culture ""for a long time"", he added. In a speech in Tynwald on Tuesday, Mr Cannan announced a series of reviews into the structure of the government, which he said was ""too big and unwieldy"". It comes after an employment tribunal found the island's most senior doctor had been unfairly dismissed, a ruling which had ""damaged confidence"" in the government, the chief minister added. 'Industry experts'Mr McDonald said a more ""efficient, productive, and leaner"" public service would help the island's economy through improved services and less competition for jobs.""There is a big skill shortage on at the moment, every job that the public sector takes is one that is gone from the private sector,"" he added. Mr Cannan told Tynwald members he would give an update on the role of the chief secretary in October, after Will Greenhow took early retirement from the position on Monday.Welcoming the move, Mr McDonald said: ""Culture comes from the top down, so getting that position right is going to be critical.""He said plans to appoint non-executive directors on government boards to provide advice and scrutiny would also be positive.""We need to make sure it is not being funnelled through cronyism or nepotism or anything like that, however, we do need industry experts in those industries, otherwise there is no point having people on these boards to advise,"" he added.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

The supermarket chain said it would offer over-60s 10% off every Tuesday to support its older customers through the cost of living crisis. The move comes as supermarkets battle for customers, with prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years.Morrisons and Asda, which have been losing shoppers to discounters Aldi and Lidl, have already cut prices.Grocery prices were 5.9% higher in April than a year ago, according to research company Kantar.That figure was the biggest increase since December 2011, with supply chain issues, increased raw material costs and the war in Ukraine all contributing to rising food prices.Why are prices rising so quickly?Five things that are going up in price and whyIceland's new discount will be launched from 24 May, with anyone aged 60 or over able to use it every Tuesday in-store at branches of Iceland and The Food Warehouse. Shoppers will need to show proof of age, such as a driving licence or senior bus or rail pass, and the discount will cover all products, with no minimum spend. Iceland said it was the first UK supermarket to introduce such a discount and decided to do so after research by Age UK found three-quarters of older people in the UK were worried about the rising cost of living. Last Christmas, Iceland also ran a regional trial offering ¬£30 vouchers to those receiving state pension and the company said it was now exploring a national rollout ready for this summer. Richard Walker, managing director at Iceland, said the chain had a ""long history"" of supporting older customers, including offering dedicated shopping hours for elderly and vulnerable people during the pandemic. ""The cost of living crisis has made support for these customers even more important, which is why I'm proud that we're finding new ways to support them, including the launch of this discount. We hope it will help all those in this age category to cut costs where they can,"" he said. UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March.The surge was driven by higher electricity and gas bills, after millions of people saw an unprecedented ¬£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month.Increased fuel and food costs also contributed, according to the Office for National Statistics.Research from Kantar suggests shoppers are turning to discount retailers as pressure on budgets grows, with Aldi the fastest growing supermarket at the beginning of this year, followed by Lidl. Many rivals have also cut their prices to compete. In March Asda said it would bring out a budget range called ""Just Essentials"" in May. Its announcement came after the supermarket was criticised by food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe for raising the prices of its value products or removing them from some stores. Meanwhile, last month Morrisons said it would offer an average 13% price cut on more than 500 goods. Sainsbury's also said it was trying to limit price increases despite facing higher costs from suppliers, lowering the prices of 150 of its most popular products.More on this storyShoppers could face ¬£271 rise in annual food bills26 AprilSupermarkets cut prices as they fight for customers25 AprilWaitrose in row with Asda over budget range name29 MarchAsda in food promise after Jack Monroe complaints7 FebruaryWhy are prices rising so quickly?5 days agoView commentsRelated TopicsIcelandRetailingCost of livingSupermarkets"

You have to help the hardest hit now.""Rishi Sunak has said the government will act where it can but said it will not be easy to cut costs for families.UK inflation is at a 40-year high of 9% as energy, food and fuel prices soar.Mr Sunak told the annual CBI dinner on Wednesday evening that the government was ""ready to do more"" to aid households.""The next few months will be tough,"" he said. ""But where we can act, we will.""The plans will involve ""cutting costs for families"" but also cutting how much government spending outpaces the income from taxes, Mr Sunak said.It is understood that he is considering ways to help people with their energy bills in July or August as well as announcing tax cuts in the Autumn Budget to support businesses.Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forwardSunak warns of tough few months as inflation soarsRoyal Mail warns it will put prices up againBut Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to act now. ""Helping people with heating bills and eating bills will not fuel inflation and you need to stimulate business investment now. That's not going to overheat the economy, it is going to make sure that any downturns in our fortunes will be short and shallow because growth is coming soon.""The inflation rate in April reached its highest level since 1982, while recent data showed the UK economy shrank in March, raising concerns the country is heading for a recession. The TUC's Kate Bell urged the government to increase state benefits now as opposed to next April and dismissed claims that IT issues prevented it from bringing forward the uplift. ""What I think we saw during the coronavirus crisis was when the economy is in trouble or when we're facing an emergency we do need to protect people and that is the best way to protect the economy.""I think that is what we need to see now and when people hear the government saying 'the computer says no', I think they are pretty clear that is an excuse, we can act if we want to,"" said Ms Bell.Why are prices rising so quickly?‚Ä¢When might the inflation rate come down?The Resolution Foundation think tank said that although everyone is affected by rapidly rising food and energy prices, the poorest households are hit hardest, because they have to spend a bigger share of their budgets on essentials than people with more money.""The scale of the cost-of-living crisis requires urgent action,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""Our benefits system is designed to get support out quickly to the low-and-middle income families at the heart of this crisis, and is the obvious way to deliver further support.""Meanwhile, the British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said that small businesses are facing a ""tsunami"" of cost increases, with energy bills more than doubling, wages going up, ""double digit supply chain inflation"", and ""business rates increased in real terms by 100%"".Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of Bira, called for the government to look to reduce business rates ""as a matter of urgency"".""Reducing business rates down to 2021 levels would give ¬£6,000 on average to small businesses, and help retailers survive in the autumn, when energy prices are set to rise again,"" Mr Goodacre said.Energy soarsThe prices of fuel, energy and food have surged in recent months, driven in part by the Ukraine war.  In April, gas and electricity prices had the biggest impact on inflation after a higher energy price cap - which limits what suppliers can charge per unit - kicked in. Homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying ¬£1,971 per year on average, up ¬£700 from the previous cap.On Wednesday, Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" and the government needed to offer households more support with their energy bills.Boss Dame Clare Moriarty said some people faced ""desperate"" situations, with ""parents skipping meals to feed their kids"" and others ""washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower"".Meanwhile, petrol and diesel prices hit new records of ¬£1.68 and ¬£1.81 per litre this week. The RAC said a family car that used diesel now cost nearly ¬£100 to fill up.""While wholesale prices dropped on Wednesday, indicating we may have passed the peak, drivers should brace themselves for further pump price rises as retailers who have had to buy new stock this week pass on their increased costs in the coming days,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.""Drivers badly need further help from the government, particularly as the Treasury is benefitting considerably from the windfall that 20% VAT brings them on these record high prices,"" he added.Opposition parties have been calling for a windfall tax on the profits of big oil and gas firms and for the money to be used to offset energy bills.But on Tuesday Conservative MPs voted down the idea, having argued it could discourage investment.More on this storyCalls to bring benefit and pension rises forward4 days agoSunak warns of tough few months as inflation soars4 days agoView commentsRelated TopicsRishi SunakCost of livingUK economyCBI"

A year later, the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia opened up its economy to companies from the West. More than three decades later, however, it is one of a growing number of corporations pulling out as the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions make it difficult to operate.McDonald's, which had nearly 850 restaurants in the country, most of them directly owned, said it expected the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, to close in coming weeks.Mr Govor has been a licensee of McDonald's since 2015. He is also co-founder of Neftekhimservice, a refining company, and a board member of another firm that owns the Park Inn hotel and private clinics in Siberia.Ukraine war could cause global food crisis - UNMcDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 yearsRussia's Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said the deal was the result of a ""long and difficult"" negotiation process and the government would provide Mr Govor with all the necessary assistance to set up operations.The terms provide for McDonald's 62,000 staff in Russia to be retained for at least two years, with their existing pay and Mr Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff in Russia until the deal is completed.McDonald's will retain its trademark in the country, it said, while the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding.Announcing plans for the sale earlier this week, chief executive Chris Kempczinski called the decision ""extremely difficult"".""However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values. And our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there,"" he said.McDonald's suspended operations at the restaurants it owned in Russia in March, citing the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the Ukraine war.The move drew outrage among Russian politicians and prompted threats the business would be seized.

The name, the same as the famous work by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, was one of several brand knock-offs of Western companies to surface.Last year, Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's revenue.The move by McDonald's came after French carmaker Renault sold its majority stake in carmaker Aftovaz to a state research institute for a symbolic sum, while its Renault Russia business was taken over by the city of Moscow.

Meanwhile, parcel deliveries increased during the pandemic.Simon Thompson, chief executive of Royal Mail, said: ""As we emerge from the pandemic, the need to accelerate the transformation of our business, particularly in delivery, has become more urgent.""Our future is as a parcels business, so we need to adapt old ways of working designed for letters and do it much more quickly to a world increasingly dominated by parcels.""Royal Mail wants fleet of 500 drones to carry mailNew stamps released to honour the Spitfire Women Royal Mail to cut jobs amid ongoing postal delaysMr Thompson said that the focus would now be to ""work at pace"" with staff and trade unions to ""reinvent this British icon for the next generations"",  give customers ""what they want"" grow the business sustainably and ""deliver long-term job security"".The price hike warning came as the business reported an 8.8% drop in pre-tax profit to ¬£662m for the year to the end of March.Royal Mail is also facing an ongoing pay dispute with its largest labour union. In January it said around 700 management roles would be cut.

"3","Cost of living: Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forward","Cost of living: Calls to bring benefit and pension rises forwardBy Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent, BBC NewsPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesMinisters are facing growing calls to bring forward large increases in benefits and the state pension which will be paid from next April.Charities want benefits to increase now to help people struggling with the cost of living, particularly energy bills.A well-established system means the annual increase in benefits will match this September's inflation rate - but will only be paid from April 2023.The Treasury says there are technical constraints in making earlier payments.Debt charity Stepchange said the government needed to address the shortfall between people's costs and their incomes. Richard Lane, from the charity, said: ""While we don't doubt that policymakers are aware of the problem, at present the measures being taken to plug the gap are simply not sufficient to help many households avoid incurring debt as a result of the rising cost of living.""Last month, Citizens Advice called on ministers to increase benefits in line with the current rate of inflation. How the system worksState benefits including universal credit, older benefits such as disability support and jobseeker's allowance, and the state pension increase once a year, in April, to match the rising cost of living.They are pegged to the inflation rate the previous September, although the state pension can also be linked to higher earnings or 2.5% - known as the triple lock.Benefits and the state pension went up by 3.1% in April this year, to match the inflation rate in September 2021.At present, that is some way behind the rate at which prices are rising, which was at a 40-year high of 9% in April according to the latest official figures.Forecasts suggest the rate of price rises could climb by this September. In turn, that would mean a rise in benefits and the state pension of close to 10% in April 2023.In reality, people are paying higher prices for things now, but will receive higher benefits later.""Intervention is urgently needed to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come because our social security system should be able to provide the protection to weather this storm,"" said Michael Clarke, head of information programmes at the charity Turn2us.""The government must act as a matter of priority and ensure that as a minimum, benefit levels are increased to meet the true cost of living and they assess their own practices of benefit deductions so that money is not taken away from people at a time where they need it most.""Should the system change?Economists at leading think tanks said there would be little effect on the public finances - and the ¬£250bn welfare bill - if the Treasury decided to bring forward some or all of that increase.""There is pressure on the government to fast-track the rise,"" said Robert Joyce, deputy director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic research group. ""There has been a reluctance to do something so far.""Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said that keeping people waiting until next April was ""a recipe for more debt"".""The main thing is the need to provide more support for those highly reliant on benefits,"" he said. He said some people on the state pension would be among the most vulnerable to rising energy bills in the coming winter.Pensioners Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72 have six daughters between them but the rising cost fuel makes visiting them very expensive. At the same time, the Southampton-based couple are grappling with an ¬£88 monthly rise in energy bills after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell.Image caption, Mike and Ev Gibbons are facing rising petrol and energy costsMr Gibbons says that each 450-500 mile trip to see some of their family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now costs ¬£25 more in petrol.Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it anymore the money's not there. We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to.""Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at charity Action for Children, said that ""more and more families are starting to run out of road as they face inflation at its highest level in a generation, spiralling energy bills set to rise further and an entirely inadequate benefits system"".He said: ""They need help with meeting basic living costs now, not warm words hinting at action in the future.""Why has no change been made?There are no plans in the Treasury to increase benefits or the state pension before next April.One of the key reasons for that, according to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is that the welfare systems involved made it technically difficult to change the uprating and paying of older benefits before April.It is possible to alter universal credit payments relatively quickly, as was done during the pandemic. Other payments such as disability support could take months to change.Mr Joyce said that IT issues were no excuse for inaction. ""Even if they need a few months' notice, that is better than waiting another year,"" he said.Mr Handscomb, from the Resolution Foundation - which focuses on people on lower incomes, said: ""If they get started now, they can do it before the next energy price rise in October.""Call to halt move to universal credit Student loan interest rate to hit 12% in EnglandHe said that the benefits system was the best way to get money to those who needed it but, even if that proved impossible, there were other ways to help people out. This targeted support could include paying more to aid people to pay their energy bills.The Treasury said such help was already in place.""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, and while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we are supporting British families to navigate the months ahead with a ¬£22bn package of support,"" a government spokesman said. ""That includes saving the typical employee over ¬£330 a year through a tax cut in July, allowing people on the universal credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn - benefiting over a million families by around ¬£1,000 a year, and providing millions of households with up to ¬£350 each to help with rising energy bills.""How has the cost of living rise been affecting you?

"3","Oil and gas industry pushes back over windfall tax","Oil and gas industry pushes back over windfall taxBy Douglas FraserBusiness and economy editor, ScotlandPublished4 days agoSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Getty ImagesOil and gas producers have hit back at calls for a windfall tax on their profits, saying they are already paying more tax as a result of price rises.Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), which represents the sector, said producers are on course to pay ¬£7.8bn in UK tax this year.That is up from ¬£3.1bn last year. However political pressure is growing for a one-off additional tax to fund support for customers facing higher energy bills.The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated the tax UK fossil fuel energy producers are expected to pay this year to be nearly twenty times the ¬£400m paid in 2020. That year, at the start of the pandemic, prices plummeted and producers sustained losses.But profits have soared this year after sharp price increases in energy prices, prompting calls for those ""exceptional"" profits to be subject to a windfall levy.The Labour opposition at Westminster has made that a key part of its attack on the government over Downing Street's handling of the cost of living crisis. Labour took the issue to a Commons vote on Wednesday, which the Opposition lost.During Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said a one-off tax on oil and gas profits ""would raise billions of pounds, cutting energy bills across the country"". In response, Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all sensible measures"" to help families.But he added that the Conservatives were ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"".How would a windfall tax on energy firms work?Windfall tax on energy firms still an optionGovernment ministers have been making the same case as the industry - that an unpredictable tax regime puts off future investment.Companies are also countering the threat of a windfall tax by pointing to their plans to spend on further developments for oil and gas, if they are allowed to, and some are switching their emphasis to renewable energy.Of the two British-based oil majors, BP is pledging ¬£18bn in UK investment this decade, and Shell has between ¬£20bn and ¬£25bn to spend on UK energy production and systems such as vehicle charging networks.Shell has produced a report into tax, which shows that in the most recent year unaffected by Covid the industry's effective tax rate was 35.5%, while the corporate tax rate in developed countries averages 23.5%.Ministers have recently been pushing for further commitments from energy producers to invest, in response to the calls for a windfall tax. That has put more pressure on the industry to make its case.Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OEUK, has written to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, warning that a windfall tax could put investment at risk. She said the industry shares the ""deep concern"" about the impact of rising energy prices on consumers.""We are proud that we are able to help by contributing a predicted ¬£7.8bn in UK taxes this year alone. ""Those payments, equivalent to ¬£279 per home, can help the government soften the pressure for households,"" she said.""This year is not a one-off. Between 2021 and 2026-27 the OBR predicts our industry will pay around ¬£23bn in UK tax.""The letter emphasised the employment created by the oil and gas industry, and its importance in the transition to renewable energy.""Our industry puts a premium on stability and predictability in the ways it is taxed and regulated,"" Ms Michie said.""Tax increases make it more expensive to borrow money for big projects - and that can make them unviable. It's why periods of fiscal stability are associated with increased investment, whereas sudden tax increases are often followed by decreased investment.""More on this storyHow would a windfall tax on energy firms work?12 MayWindfall tax U-turn inevitable, says Starmer4 days agoWindfall tax on energy firms still an option11 MayShell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge5 MayRelated TopicsCompaniesEnergy industryNorth Sea oil and gasUK economyOil & Gas industry"

UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March.The surge came as millions of people saw an unprecedented ¬£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month.Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are also pushing the cost of living up, with inflation expected to continue to rise this year. Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" for the government to offer more support for households, and debt charities urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help earlier rather than later in the year.Live updates: Inflation hits 9% as cost of living crisis deepensWhen might the inflation rate come down?Around three quarters of the rise in inflation in April came from higher electricity and gas bills, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).""There are desperate stories behind these figures,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""People washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower; parents skipping meals to feed their kids; disabled people who can't afford to use vital equipment because of soaring energy bills."" 'I can't do much more'Image caption, Cheryl Holmes said there was not much more she could do to save money as her bills rose and salary stayed the sameHealth analyst Cheryl Holmes, a mother-of-two, said she was trying to keep her living costs down to ""as low as possible"" by spending less on food and clothes, and cancelling TV subscriptions.""I've already for several years been turning the lights off in each room, setting the heating on a timer, making sure I'm using a full dishwasher and washing machine and I'm running out of ideas. ""It's a battle and it seems like there's not really much more that I can do.""UK inflation: 'I'm batch cooking and freezing food'A higher energy price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - kicked in last month, meaning homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying ¬£1,971 per year on average.Up until now households of all incomes had faced similar rates of inflation, but the poorest are now being hit hardest by rising prices because they have to spend far more of their household budgets on gas and electricity, think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.The ONS, which publishes the UK's inflation rate, said the costs of food, machinery, furniture and other household goods also rose in April.""All items"" on the menus of restaurants and cafes went up too, due to the VAT rate for hospitality returning to 20% after being cut during the pandemic to help businesses.Meanwhile, average petrol prices stood at ¬£1.62 per litre in April 2022, the highest on record, compared with ¬£1.26 per litre a year earlier.Why are prices rising so quickly?Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spendingInflation is the rate at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs ¬£1 and that rises by 9p, then milk inflation is 9%.Prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, and wages are failing to keep pace. The ONS estimated inflation is now at its highest level since March 1982, when it stood at 9.1%.The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch could leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year amid further expected rises in energy bills.UK inflation is simply not supposed to hit levels this high. And as the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said, these sorts of rises hit the poorest the hardest. 9% is an average across the population. The older Retail Prices Index measure is already at 11%. But Mr Bailey's institution has a battle on now to get this under control. The really painful issue is that this rate will sustain and is on course to get higher over the course of this year. And only this week he acknowledged that there was ""not a lot"" the Bank could do about four-fifths of the anticipated rise, as it is being imported from globally rising prices for energy and food .Read more here.With households under increasing pressure, the government faces growing calls to offer more help.Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""cannot protect people completely"" from rising inflation as it was a global problem.Mr Sunak is expected to call on businesses at the CBI's annual dinner later to boost investment and training in order to grow the economy and help ease the cost of living crunch.He will pledge that he will cut taxes on firms in the Autumn to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"".Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all the measures"" needed to help people struggling with rising bills.Sir Keir Starmer pressed the PM on Labour's call for a one-off tax on oil and gas profits, arguing it would raise ""billions"" to help.The PM replied that the government was ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"". The rising cost of living is already seeing people spending less money and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs.It's impacting the economy, which shrank in March and risks falling into recession next year, according to the Bank of England.Bank of England faces criticismThe Bank's response has been to raise interest rates to try and cool prices. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand. However, it the Bank has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Governor Andrew Bailey defended its response, insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do.But UK now has the highest rate of inflation (9%) of any G7 country, including Germany (7.4%) and France (4.8%).Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said higher prices in the UK risked becoming embedded due to wages ""spiralling upwards"" as firms fought for talent.There are currently more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, partly because many people dropped out of the labour market during the pandemic.Ms Streeter said prices across the hospitality and leisure industries were now at a 30-year high.""So far companies have succeeded in passing on higher costs to customers keeping margins resilient, but worries do linger about just how long consumers will continue to pay the price,"" she added.

The cost of beer is also rising.One of the reasons behind the shortage is a hike in energy prices which is causing the price of glass bottle production to increase, a glass industry spokesperson told Bild.In addition, Holger Eichele of the German Brewers' Federation said a lack of lorry drivers was making it harder to maintain supply chains. As a result, he said the cost of new glass bottles had nearly doubled in the last year. It follows warnings that the cost of German beer could rise by up to 30%, also due largely to the increase in energy prices. The shortage of bottles is likely to hit smaller breweries the hardest, because the bigger companies are typically supplied first. Mr Eichele said the best thing Germans could do was to return glass bottles to retailers as quickly as possible, advising consumers not to ""hoard empties in the basement"".Glass bottles, which are common in Germany, are sold with a small deposit, and beer drinkers are expected to bring them back to the shop when getting their next round.Cans, used elsewhere in the world, are far less common and many breweries use customised bottles that are tricky to replace.More on this storyBeer sales surge as Germany swelters31 July 2018Related TopicsGermanyBeer"

We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to.""The business boss: 'We're trying not to put prices up'Image source, Getty ImagesClive Watson, executive chairman of the City Pub Group, said that despite rising costs, he doesn't believe that raising prices for customers is the ""right thing to do at the moment"". Electricity has more than doubled, while food costs have gone up by around 15% and labour costs have risen by 7 - 8% for the pub chain. Mr Watson said the business, which has 45 pubs across the south of England, was ""trying not to put prices up"" and had not shrunk portions to cut costs. While menu changes can reduce costs, for instance by offering more pork dishes as it is cheaper than chicken, Mr Watson explained this was  ""just tinkering at the edges"" and ""doesn't disguise"" the rapid supplier cost increases.  ""We are having to take a lot of these costs on the chin which obviously affects the bottom line,"" he said. Mr Watson explained that the government had supported hospitality during the pandemic but that his main concern now was its support for his customers.  Food and fuel poverty left unchecked he said, meant that people would not be able to afford to go out and spend their money. ""There is a crisis in consumer confidence and the government has got to address that,"" he said.More on this storyEnergy bills push price rises to 40-year high4 days agoWhy are prices rising so quickly?5 days agoRecession fears grow as rising prices hit spending12 MayRelated TopicsMoneyPersonal financeInflationCost of livingShopping"

But Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, said comparing pump prices against wholesale prices ""only gives a partial picture"".Once ""additional expenses"" such as storage and delivery costs are taken into account alongside the ""volatility of product prices"", retailers' margins are ""often not enough to cover operating costs"", he said.He added that if the government wanted to lower pump prices, it should reduce fuel duty by more than 5p.""5p per litre did not represent a substantial enough cut to ease the burden of rising prices on motorists,"" he said.""While the chancellor was announcing it, oil prices rose and effectively cancelled out the reduction. In addition to this,  sales volumes of petrol and diesel are still not back to their pre-pandemic levels.""Supermarkets and independent fuel retailers are competing vigorously with each other on the thinnest of margins.""Supermarkets 'reluctant' to cut fuel pricesThe row follows a warning that supermarkets have also not passed on the fuel duty cut and falls in wholesale fuel prices.The RAC motoring group does not believe the top four supermarkets - Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco - are doing enough to help customers cut their fuel bills.RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""Despite operating just a fifth of petrol stations in the UK, the big supermarkets are responsible for around half of all fuel sales so how they choose to price petrol and diesel has a huge impact on what drivers end up paying.""Retailers make shocking petrol profit, says RAC Drivers cut back on journeys as fuel costs biteHe added: ""When wholesale fuel prices fall dramatically it can be enormously frustrating for drivers when pump prices don't start coming down. It normally takes one retailer to effectively 'fire the starting gun' and cut its prices in order for others to follow.""We know that the biggest retailers tend to be reluctant to reflect falling wholesale prices at the pumps day-to-day, yet they seem to pass on increases quickly when wholesale prices are rising. This can often be to the detriment of drivers.""The RAC believes that supermarkets often wait for long sustained drops in wholesale prices before they cut their forecourt prices. If they cut the retail price too soon and then the wholesale price rises again, they will be forced to reintroduce a higher price which looks bad to customers, according to the motoring organisation.A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: ""We understand that the cost of living is a real challenge for many households and we are committed to helping our customers as much as we can.""We lowered prices the day the chancellor announced fuel cuts so that our customers could benefit as soon as possible.""Morrisons said it took the full 5p from its prices at 6pm on the day of the chancellor's announcement.Asda and Tesco have not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.More on this storyDiesel prices reach record of over ¬£1.80 a litre6 days agoHow much will the fuel duty cut on petrol save you?23 MarchView commentsRelated TopicsCompaniesFuelOil & Gas industryMotoring"

It will take weeks for products to hit shelves after reopening, officials said.The plant in Sturgis has been closed since February after bacteria was found in the facility, prompting recalls of several products.The shutdown and recalls worsened a shortage that had been percolating for months due to supply chain and logistics delays and spiralled further after parents rushed to the stores to stock up.The White House has been under pressure to respond to the problem.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Worry and fear as baby formula shortage continuesOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration said the US was working to address the issue, including easing rules to allow increased foreign shipments.""With increased production by other manufacturers, forthcoming import actions and the potential for Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis facility to resume production in the near-term, the FDA expects supply to continue to improve over the next couple of months,"" it said. The FDA said sales of infant formula rose 13% in April compared to January, before the recall, and some indicators suggested that the out-of-stock rates had been over-stated.""Increased sales are a good indicator of formula available to the general population,"" it said.More on this storyUS faces baby formula 'crisis' as shortage worsens9 MayWorry and fear as US faces baby formula shortage13 MayRelated TopicsCompaniesUS economy"
