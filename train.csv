Credit: Christine Daniloff, MITCompared to native-born American citizens, immigrants are more frequently involved in founding companies at all scales.Immigrants to the United States are more likely to start businesses than native-born Americans are, according to a study that takes a wide-ranging look at registered businesses across the country.Co-authored by an MIT economist, Pierre Azoulay, the research finds that, per capita, immigrants are about 80% more likely to found a firm, compared to U.S.-born citizens. Those firms also have about 1% more employees than those founded by U.S. natives, on average.“Immigrants, relative to natives and relative to their share of the population, found more firms of every size,” says Pierre Azoulay, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-author of a published paper detailing the study’s results.Taking firm creation into account, the study results indicate that immigration to the U.S. is associated with a net gain in job availability, contrary to the common perception that immigrants fill jobs that U.S.-born workers would otherwise have.“The findings suggest that immigrants act more as ‘job creators’ than ‘job takers’ and that non-U.S. born founders play outsized roles in U.S. high-growth entrepreneurship,” the authors write in the paper.The paper, “Immigration and Entrepreneurship in the United States,” appears in the spring issue of American Economic Review: Insights. The authors are Azoulay, who is the International Programs Professor of Management at MIT Sloan; Benjamin Jones, the Gordon and Llura Gund Professor of Entrepreneurship and a professor of strategy at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management; J. Daniel Kim PhD ’20, an assistant professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School; and Javier Miranda, a principal economist at the U.S. Census Bureau.Three scales of firmsTo conduct the study, the scholars examined three types of data sources. To begin with, the researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data and tax records for all new firms founded in the U.S. from 2005 through 2010, a total of 1.02 million businesses. This allowed them to study firm creation and job growth in those companies over a five-year period.Of course, many U.S. firms were founded earlier than 2005. To analyze those firms and their founders, the research team examined the U.S. Census Bureau’s Survey of Business Owners from 2012, a periodic survey with data covering 200,000 businesses and including data about the owners. This allowed the scholars to expand the study’s time period and include many larger firms.However, many of the largest companies in the U.S. do not respond to the Survey of Business Owners. For this reason, the research team also analyzed the 2017 Fortune 500, identifying the citizenship and immigration status of founders of 449 of those companies.Ultimately, the study showed that 0.83 percent of immigrants to the U.S. founded a firm from 2005 to 2010, while 0.46 percent of native-born U.S. citizens founded a firm in that time. That disparity — the 80 percent higher rate of firm founding — also held up among firms founded before 2005.“Immigrants found more firms in every bucket,” Azoulay says. “They create more firms, they create more small firms, they create more medium-size firms, they create more large firms.” He adds: “It’s not the case that [immigrants] only create growth-oriented startups. It’s not the case they just create subsistence businesses. They create all kinds of businesses, and they create a lot of them.”Azoulay emphasizes that the study, which focused on the empirical facts about business creation, does not explain why immigrants tend to found firms more often. It may be that some immigrants, finding it hard to access the U.S. workforce as employees, may start service-type businesses instead.Alternately, some immigrants to the U.S. arrive as students, stay in the country, and found high-growth, high-tech startup firms. The breadth of the overall trend suggests there are likely multiple such scenarios in play at once.“There can’t be just one explanation,” Azoulay says. “There is probably a different story for the firms that eventually grow to be large, and for the firms that start small and stay small.”Facts for a larger discussionAs the researchers note, defining whether a firm’s founders are immigrants is not always a straightforward matter. Some firms have multiple founders, representing a mix of immigrants and native-born people.To address this issue, the scholars tested multiple ways of classifying firm data. In one iteration of the analysis, they allocated credit for firm founding proportionately among founders. In another iteration, they only credited a firm as being founded by an immigrant if the “lead” founder was an immigrant. Still another round of analysis defined a firm as being immigrant-founded if any member of the founding team was an immigrant. All these methodologies yielded the same large-scale trend.Indeed, as the authors write in the paper, “Immigrants appear to play a relatively strong role in expanding labor demand relative to labor supply, compared to the native-born population.”Azoulay notes that debates over immigration policy may have many dimensions and are not always going to revolve around the economics. Still, when it comes to that economic impact, and specifically to the issue of job creation and availability, Azoulay hopes the study will provide some baseline data points for public consumption.“Any discussion needs to start from a common set of facts,” Azoulay says.Reference: “Immigration and Entrepreneurship in the United States” by Pierre Azoulay, Benjamin F.

"4","Science Made Simple: What is Ultrafast Science?","Ultrafast science is the study of processes in atoms, molecules, or materials on a femtosecond scale or faster. A femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second, or 10-15 seconds.Ultrafast science is the study of processes in atoms, molecules, or materials that occur in millionths of a billionth of a second or faster. This timescale is called femtoseconds, which is equivalent to 10-15 seconds. With ultrafast science, researchers use short pulses of photons, electrons, and ions to probe matter. Femtosecond X-ray pulses can produce stop-motion pictures of how atoms move during molecular transformations or how they vibrate on thin film surfaces. This timescale allows scientists to investigate the details of how processes fundamental to life change over time. For example, they can study how chemical bonds break and form and how excited electrons reshape the energy landscape of materials transformations.Newer tools can produce pulses of duration in the hundreds of attoseconds (10-18 seconds). These even faster pulses enable scientists to track how electrons move when they are excited in chemical reactions.Scientists for the first time tracked ultrafast structural changes as ring-shaped gas molecules unraveled after being split open by light. The measurements were compiled in sequence as the basis for computer animations showing molecular motion. Credit: Video courtesy SLAC National Accelerator LaboratoryUltrafast science experiments increase our understanding of how atomic, electronic, and magnetic structures move and change on fundamental time scales. They also help us link those results to materials and chemical properties. Scientists studying these phenomena gain new insights on how to design materials with new properties and more efficient chemical processes.Ultrafast Science FactsThe development of X-ray free electron lasers is a breakthrough for ultrafast science.Ahmed Zewail was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for inventing “femtochemistry.”In one femtosecond, light travels just 300 nanometers, a distance comparable to the size of a virus.A femtosecond is to 1 second as 1 second is to 30 million years.To date, the shortest X-ray laser pulses delivered by LCLS last 5 femtoseconds, about the same time a molecule takes to lose an electron.Most ultrafast experiments involve the narrow time pulse capability of optical lasers. These laser pulses can then be converted into other kinds of pulses. The result is that researchers can tailor experiments choosing pulses from a selection of electromagnetic radiation energy (including X-rays), and particles such as electrons.The most common form of ultrafast experiment involves a “pump” pulse to excite the material to be investigated, and after a selected ultra-short time delay, a “probe” pulse to measure a feature in the sample. Scientists vary the time delay and measure the time history of the excited state as the system returns to equilibrium. The pump and probe can be different types of pulses, depending on the type of excitation desired and the type of property to be measured.DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Ultrafast ScienceThe DOE Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) invests in fundamental research and user facilities for ultrafast science. This research includes fundamental investigations of changes in materials’ electronic structure and the flow of energy in new materials and chemical systems. The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a premier facility for ultrafast science research. LCLS was the first hard X-ray free-electron laser in the world. It uses powerful flashes of X-ray light–each as brief as 5 femtoseconds and a billion times brighter than those available before–to take atomic snapshots. The LCLS will be even more powerful when SLAC completes work on the upgraded LCLS-II. Researchers string these together to create movies of chemical and physical processes. Insights into these fundamental, ultrafast motions could help solve some of the mysteries of the natural world and support the development of innovative materials, energy solutions, medicines, and more."

Researchers in the Dinneny lab study this plant to understand this special adaptation and how they might be able to modify other plants to withstand similarly stressful environments. Credit: José DinnenyWhen plants are faced with conditions that are too dry, salty, or cold, most of them try to conserve resources. They send out fewer leaves and roots and close up their pores to hold in water. If circumstances don’t improve, they eventually die.But some plants, known as extremophytes, have evolved to survive in harsh environments. Schrenkiella parvula, a scraggly, branching member of the mustard family, not only survives but thrives in conditions that would kill most plants. It grows along the shores of Lake Tuz in Turkey, where salt concentrations in the water can be six times higher than that of the ocean. In a paper published in Nature Plants on May 2, 2022, scientists at Stanford University discovered that Schrenkiella parvula actually grows faster under these stressful conditions.“Most plants produce a stress hormone that acts like a stop signal for growth,” said José Dinneny, an associate professor of biology at Stanford, who is senior author of the paper. “But in this extremophyte, it’s a green light. The plant accelerates its growth in response to this stress hormone.”Image of an S. parvula root taken with a confocal microscope. Credit: Prashanth RamachandranDinneny and his colleagues are studying Schrenkiella parvula to learn more about how some plants cope with adverse conditions. Their findings could aid scientists in engineering crops that are able to grow in lower-quality soil and adapt to the stresses of climate change.“With climate change, we can’t expect the environment to stay the same,” said Ying Sun, a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute who earned her doctorate at Stanford and is a lead author on the paper. “Our crops are going to have to adapt to these rapidly changing conditions. If we can understand the mechanisms that plants use to tolerate stress, we can help them do it better and faster.”An unexpected responseSchrenkiella parvula is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which contains cabbage, broccoli, turnips, and other important food crops. In areas where climate change is expected to increase the duration and intensity of droughts, it would be valuable if these crops were able to weather or even thrive in those dry spells.When plants encounter dry, salty, or cold conditions – all of which create water-related stress – they produce a hormone called abscisic acid, or ABA. This hormone activates specific genes, essentially telling the plant how to respond. The researchers examined how several plants in the Brassicaceae family, including Schrenkiella parvula, responded to ABA. While the other plants’ growth slowed or stopped, the roots of Schrenkiella parvula grew significantly faster.Schrenkiella parvula is closely related to the other plants in the study and has a very similar-sized genome, but ABA is activating different sections of its genetic code to create a completely different behavior.“That rewiring of that network explains, at least partially, why we’re getting these different growth responses in stress-tolerant species,” Dinneny said.Engineering future cropsUnderstanding this stress response – and how to engineer it in other species – could help more than just food crops, Dinneny said. Schrenkiella parvula is also related to several oilseed species that have the potential to be engineered and used as sustainable sources of jet fuel or other biofuels. If these plants can be adapted to grow in harsher environmental conditions, there would be more land available for cultivating them.“You want to be growing bioenergy crops on land that is not suitable for growing food – say, an agricultural field that has degraded soil or has accumulated salinity because of improper irrigation,” Dinneny said. “These areas are not prime agricultural real estate, but land that would be abandoned otherwise.”Dinneny and his colleagues are continuing to investigate the network of responses that could help plants survive in extreme conditions. Now that they have an idea of how Schrenkiella parvula sustains its growth in the face of limited water and high salinity, they will try to engineer related plants to be able to do the same by tweaking which genes are activated by ABA.“We’re trying to understand what the secret sauce is for these plant species – what allows them to grow in these unique environments, and how we can use this knowledge to engineer specific traits in our crops,” Dinneny said.Reference: “Divergence in the ABA gene regulatory network underlies differential growth control” by Ying Sun, Dong-Ha Oh, Lina Duan, Prashanth Ramachandran, Andrea Ramirez, Anna Bartlett, Kieu-Nga Tran, Guannan Wang, Maheshi Dassanayake and José R.

"4","Overlooked “Jurassic Park of Lizards” Discovered by Researchers","New research challenges the current consensus that the radiation of squamates – a key modern group of reptiles that includes lizards and snakes – happened in the Cretaceous period.Scientists have found that a key modern group of reptiles that includes lizards and snakes – known as squamates – diverged in the Jurassic period, 50 million years earlier than previously thought.New research published on May 3, 2022, in the journal eLife by scientists from the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont (ICP) and the University of Bristol challenges the current consensus that the radiation of squamates happened in the Cretaceous period. This was when many terrestrial tetrapod groups like mammals, lizards, and birds, apparently underwent a great diversification during the so-called Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, which was triggered by the rise of flowering plants.The fossil of Jurassic lizard Eichstaettisaurus. Credit: Jorge Herrera FloresNow, a new research study, led by Dr. Arnau Bolet, a paleontologist at the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont and the University of Bristol, implies a much earlier radiation of squamates. Along with colleagues from Bristol’s School of Earth Sciences, Prof Michael Benton, Dr. Tom Stubbs, and Jorge Herrera-Flores, their research concludes that this group of reptiles probably achieved a diverse array of adaptations in the Jurassic (between 201 and 145 Myr.), long before current estimates.“Even though Jurassic squamates are rare, reconstructed evolutionary trees show that all the main specializations of squamates evolved then, and it’s possible to distinguish adaptations of geckoes, iguanas, skinks, worm lizards, and snakes some 50 million years earlier than had been thought,” explains Michael Benton, co-author of the research. “But how could the scarce Jurassic fossils suggest an early burst in evolution? The key is in their anatomy.”Collared lizard in Colorado. Credit: Pahcal123 (CC BY-SA 4.0)The few Jurassic squamates do not show primitive morphologies as would be expected, but they relate directly to the diverse modern groups. “Instead of finding a suite of generalized lizards on the stem of the squamate tree, what we found in the Jurassic were the first representatives of many modern groups, showing advanced morphological features,” says Arnau Bolet, lead author of the article.The observed times of divergence, morphospace plots, and evolutionary rates, all suggest that the Jurassic was a time of innovation in squamate evolution, during which the bases of the success of the group were established. According to these results, the apparent sudden increase in diversity observed in the Cretaceous could be related to an improved fossil record, capable of recording a larger number of species, or to a burst of origins of new species related to the new kinds of forests and insects.The Squamata is the largest order of reptiles, including lizards, snakes, and worm lizards. Squamates are all cold-blooded, and their skins are covered by horny scales. They are key parts of modern terrestrial faunas, especially in warmer climates, with an astonishing diversity of more than 10,000 species. However, the evolutionary paths that forged their success are still poorly understood.Establishing the timing and mode of radiation of squamates is key for not only understanding the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the Mesozoic, but also for deciphering how the group achieved an astonishing diversity of more than 10,000 species, only rivaled by birds among tetrapods.Reference: “The Jurassic rise of squamates as supported by lepidosaur disparity and evolutionary rates” by Arnau Bolet, Thomas L Stubbs, Jorge A Herrera-Flores and Michael J Benton, 3 May 2022, eLife.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.66511"
"4","Before Stonehenge Monuments, Hunter-Gatherers Made Use of Open Woodland Habitats","According to a new study, hunter-gatherers made use of open woodland conditions in the millennia before Stonehenge monuments were built.Research study investigates habitat conditions encountered by first farmers and monument-builders.Hunter-gatherers made use of open woodland conditions in the millennia before Stonehenge monuments were built, according to a study by Samuel Hudson of the University of Southampton, U.K., and colleagues that was published on April 27, 2022, in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.Much research has explored the Bronze Age and Neolithic history of the region surrounding Stonehenge, but less is known about earlier times in this area. This leaves open questions about how ancient people and wildlife used this area prior to the construction of the famous archaeological monuments. In this new paper, Hudson and colleagues reconstruct environmental conditions at the site of Blick Mead, a pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer site on the edge of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site.The authors combine pollen, spores, sedimentary DNA, and animal remains to characterize the pre-Neolithic habitat of the site, inferring partially open woodland conditions, which would have been beneficial to large grazing herbivores like aurochs, as well as hunter-gatherer communities. This study supports previous evidence that the Stonehenge region was not covered in closed canopy forest at this time, as has previously been proposed.A) Timeline of the Stonehenge landscape, including radiocarbon dates from Blick Mead and other significant Stonehenge World Heritage Archaeological Sites.

Credit: Hudson et al., 2022, PLOS ONE, CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)This study also provides date estimates for human activity at Blick Mead. Results indicate that hunter-gatherers used this site for 4,000 years up until the time of the earliest known farmers and monument-builders in the region, who would also have benefited from the space provided in open environments. These results indicate that the first farmers and monument-builders in the Stonehenge area encountered open habitats already maintained and used by large grazers and earlier human populations.Further study on similar sites will provide important insights into the interactions between hunter-gatherers and early farming communities in the U.K. and elsewhere. Furthermore, this study provides techniques for combining sedimentary DNA, other ecological data, and stratigraphic data to interpret the ancient environment at a site where such information is difficult to assess.The authors add: “The Stonehenge World Heritage Site is globally recognized for its rich Neolithic and Bronze Age monumental landscape, but little is known of its significance to Mesolithic populations. Environmental research at Blick Mead suggests that hunter-gatherers had already chosen part of this landscape, an alluvial clearing, as a persistent place for hunting and occupation.”Reference: “Life before Stonehenge: The hunter-gatherer occupation and environment of Blick Mead revealed by sedaDNA, pollen and spores” by Samuel M.

"4","Scientists “Magically” Mine Metals From Water","PNNL chemical engineer Jian Liu observes laboratory equipment used to extract rare earth elements from various water sources. This magnetic separation loop system works in tandem with tiny, magnetic particles that are added to the water, quickly drawing out the element for easy extraction. Credit: Photo by Andrea Starr | Pacific Northwest National LaboratoryAlchemists sought to transform lead into gold centuries ago. While they were not successful, the notion of extracting precious resources from abundant sources remains alluring.Scientists at the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are collaborating with industry to test a method that employs magnetic nanoparticles to extract important minerals like lithium from various water sources.Lithium is an essential ingredient in many electronic and energy technologies, including the lightweight lithium-ion batteries that power everything from cell phones to electric vehicles.Credit: Video by Pacific Northwest National LaboratoryThe global market for lithium is projected to reach $8.2 billion by 2028, but precious little is produced in the United States.Not only does PNNL’s patent-pending technology potentially give the U.S. an opportunity to produce more of its own lithium and other critical materials, but it also offers a much faster and less expensive way of doing so. PNNL is developing magnetic nanoparticles that are surrounded by an adsorbent shell that latches onto the lithium and other metals found in water associated with various industrial processes.These sources could include the water in geothermal power plants, known as geothermal brines, or water pulled from the subsurface during oil or gas production. The particles also could be used in effluents from desalination plants, or even directly from seawater. Once the tiny, iron-based particles are added to the water, the lithium is drawn out of the water and binds to them. Then, with the help of a magnet, the nanoparticles can be collected in just minutes with the lithium hitching a ride, no longer suspended in the liquid and ready for easy extraction. After the lithium is extracted, the recharged nanoparticles can be used again.This technology offers a promising alternative to conventional extraction methods that pump groundwater into large, costly evaporating ponds. Those processes can take months or even years and impact groundwater management in the arid regions where they are mainly deployed.While the PNNL process goes to work immediately, today’s processes are a bit like waiting for the water to evaporate from a pitcher of lemonade in hopes of reclaiming the powdered mix settling at the bottom. If this technology were deployed at geothermal plants, the value of recovered lithium could potentially increase the cost-effectiveness of this form of renewable energy, which uses water to capture the heat deep below the Earth’s surface and then converts it into electricity.PNNL is further developing this technology in a partnership with Moselle Technologies, which has licensed it and plans to pilot it in several locations.This effort and the follow-on activities are great examples of how the national laboratories collaborate with commercial entities to transition lab research into real-world solutions.For instance, researchers at PNNL are conducting long-duration tests of the magnetic separator system for potential use with oil and gas extraction processes, which could create an additional revenue stream to offset production costs.In addition to Moselle, they are teaming with other commercial partners to evaluate the use of the technology for their lithium resources in Nevada and Canada.Finally, with an eye on a different set of applications, researchers at PNNL are customizing the shell of the nanoparticle to specifically target other commercially valuable, strategically important elements and minerals used in energy technologies, medical imaging devices, electronics and more.For example, they are collaborating with Moselle and Geo40 to explore the possibility of extracting cesium and antimony from geothermal brines at a geothermal plant in New Zealand.Though none of these efforts amount to sorcery, one could forgive the alchemists of yore for mistaking this marvel of chemistry for magic.PNNL’s novel approach is truly remarkable. It offers the promise of extracting critical minerals in a quick, cost-effective manner. And innovation like this just might be worth its weight in gold."
"4","This Kind of Flirting Works Best – According to Science","Smiling and making eye contact is important. But one particular flirting technique almost always works for everyone and in every situation.Some people succeed at flirting more often than others. Plenty of people are obviously more attractive than the rest of us, but it also seems that a lot of them know what works. Now researchers do, too.Some people are experts at flirting. Others of us never flirt or fail spectacularly. But what kind of flirting is most effective?One particular flirting technique almost always works for everyone and in every situation. More on that later, because not everything works every time.“What’s most effective depends on your gender and whether the purpose of the flirtation is a long-term or short-term relationship,” says Leif Edward Ottesen Kennair, a professor in the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).Kennair belongs to a research group that has studied flirting in Norway and the USA and what people believe are effective tactics – and for whom and in what context.The research group came from NTNU and from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and State University of New York at Oswego.What’s most effective depends on your gender and whether the purpose of the flirtation is a long-term or short-term relationship.We flirt… well, because of thisBut first: What exactly is flirting?“Flirting involves different signals that people send to each other. It’s done to attract potential partners. Men and women both flirt to get the attention of a desired partner, and perhaps to achieve a sexual or romantic result from it,” says Professor Kennair.“Flirting can be done verbally as well as non-verbally says T. Joel Wade, a Presidential Professor of Psychology at Bucknell University in the USA,” a co-author of the study.We basically flirt to attract a potential partner, regardless of whether we stop before it gets that far or not.So what works? Let’s look first at what works sometimes, but not always and not for everyone.We basically flirt to attract a potential partner, regardless of whether we stop before it gets that far or not.Gender and purpose at play“People consider signals that you’re sexually available to be the most effective for women who are looking for a short-term relationship,” says Kennair.Friendly contact like hugging or a kiss on the cheek doesn’t work in that context. Women who just want a short-lived fling from flirting need to signalize this clearly to the potential partner.A completely different tactic works in another mating context.The study shows that “signs of generosity and a willingness to commit works best for men who are looking for a long-term relationship,” says professor and colleague Mons Bendixen.Men who want to keep a partner for a longer period of time, perhaps for life, should not come across as stingy/ungenerous or as someone who prefers to change partners frequently.If you need to flirt, but feel unsure about how to proceed, then humor is something you should put in your toolkit. But maybe you shouldn’t start with that.Strongest flirting weapon for anyoneBut the most powerful weapon in the flirtation arsenal might come as a surprise to people who don’t have it. This weapon almost always works to some degree for everyone.Humor.“People think that humor, or being able to make another person laugh, is most effective for men who are looking for a long-term relationship. It’s least effective for women who are looking for a one-night stand. But laughing or giggling at the other person’s jokes is an effective flirtation tactic for both sexes,” says Kennair.“It is not only effective to be funny, but for women it is very important that you show your potential partner that you think they are funny” Rebecca Burch, a co-author from SUNY Oswego, US, added.If you need to flirt, but feel unsure about how to proceed, then humor is something you should add to your toolkit. But maybe you shouldn’t start with that.“Smiling and eye contact are important. Then you can build your flirting skills from that base, using more advanced tactics,” Kennair says.“Smiling and eye contact are important. Then you can build your flirting skills from that base, using more advanced tactics.” – Leif Edward Ottesen KennairSupports previous findingsThe researchers applied sexual strategies theory as a framework to their work. Variants of this theory have also been used in other contexts that deal with how men and women proceed to find partners. This is the first time the theory is being used to examine flirting effectiveness.“The findings fit perfectly with what we know from the literature on self-promotion. It also seems that flirting is largely the same in the US and Norway,” Kennair says.Mostly these are the same flirting techniques that people believe are effective in both Norway and the USA. Flirting is only culturally dependent to a lesser extent, such as in people’s body language, the initial contact and in the degree of generosity.This indicates that effective flirting is largely universal, which is not surprising since the motivations for finding a mate are partly biological, Wade says.However, this also shows that people fine-tune their flirting techniques depending on what is emphasized in their culture, which is a smart, flexible strategy, Burch adds.ApproachThe researchers surveyed close to 1000 students in Norway and the USA. The participants rated how effective 40 different types of flirting were for a long-term or a short-term relationship, and whether the flirter was male or female. Participants were randomly assigned to the four versions of the questionnaire.The researchers took into account the participants’ extroversion, age, religiosity, how willing the person was to have a relationship and “mate value,” that is, how attractive you are in the dating market.“Individual differences in age, religiosity, extroversion, personal attractiveness and preferences for short-term sexual relationships had little or no effect on how effective respondents considered the various flirting tactics to be,” says Bendixen.Our personality may therefore be less relevant in how we judge flirting behavior in others.“However, we do believe that personal characteristics affect the type of flirting people employ themselves,” says Bendixen.Reference: “Perceived Effectiveness of Flirtation Tactics: The Effects of sex, Mating Context and Individual Differences in US and Norwegian Samples” by Leif Edward Ottesen Kennair, T.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Marine Microbiology predict that their findings are relevant for many marine environments with plants, including other seagrass species, mangroves, and saltmarshes. Credit: HYDRA Marine Sciences GmbHSweet Spots in the Sea: Mountains of Sugar Under Seagrass MeadowsSeagrass beds are underwater oases. Now scientists have discovered vast amounts of sugars underneath seagrass meadows. This sheds new light on how plants store carbon in the ocean.Seagrasses form lush green meadows in many coastal areas around the world. These marine plants are one of the most efficient global carbon sinks on the planet: One square kilometer of seagrass stores almost twice as much carbon as forests on land, and 35 times as fast. Now scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany, have discovered that seagrasses release massive amounts of sugar into their soils, the so-called rhizosphere. Sugar concentrations underneath the seagrass were at least 80 times greater than previously measured in marine environments.“To put this into perspective: We estimate that worldwide there are between 0.6 and 1.3 million tons of sugar, mainly in the form of sucrose, in the seagrass rhizosphere,” explains Manuel Liebeke, head of the Research Group Metabolic Interactions at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology. “That is roughly comparable to the amount of sugar in 32 billion cans of coke!”Beautiful to look at, hard to sample: Measuring metabolites like sucrose and polyphenols in seawater is difficult. The scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen had to develop a special method to deal with the large amounts of salt in seawater that make measurements of metabolites so difficult. Credit: HYDRA Marine Sciences GmbHPolyphenols keep microbes from eating the sugarMicroorganisms love sugar: It is easy to digest and full of energy. So why isn’t the sucrose consumed by the huge community of microbes in the seagrass rhizosphere? “We spent a long time trying to figure this out,” says first author Maggie Sogin, who led the research off the Italian island of Elba and at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology.“That is roughly comparable to the amount of sugar in 32 billion cans of coke!”“What we realized is that seagrass, like many other plants, release phenolic compounds to their sediments. Red wine, coffee, and fruits are full of phenolics, and many people take them as health supplements. What is less well known is that phenolics are antimicrobials and inhibit the metabolism of most microorganisms. “In our experiments, we added phenolics isolated from seagrass to the microorganisms in the seagrass rhizosphere – and indeed, much less sucrose was consumed compared to when no phenolics were present.”Some specialists thrive on sugars in the seagrass rhizosphereWhy do seagrasses produce such large amounts of sugars, to then only dump them into their rhizosphere? Nicole Dubilier, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology explains: “Seagrasses produce sugar during photosynthesis. Under average light conditions, these plants use most of the sugars they produce for their own metabolism and growth. But under high light conditions, for example at midday or during the summer, the plants produce more sugar than they can use or store. Then they release the excess sucrose into their rhizosphere. Think of it as an overflow valve.”Manuel Liebeke and Nicole Dubilier in the lab.

Sogin speculates that these sucrose specialists are not only able to digest sucrose and degrade phenolics, but might provide benefits for the seagrass by producing nutrients it needs to grow, such as nitrogen. “Such beneficial relationships between plants and rhizosphere microorganisms are well known in land plants, but we are only just beginning to understand the intimate and intricate interactions of seagrasses with microorganisms in the marine rhizosphere,” she adds.Endangered and critical habitatsSeagrass meadows are among the most threatened habitats on our planet. “Looking at how much blue carbon – that is carbon captured by the world’s ocean and coastal ecosystems – is lost when seagrass communities are decimated, our research clearly shows: It is not only the seagrass itself, but also the large amounts of sucrose underneath live seagrasses that would result in a loss of stored carbon. Our calculations show that if the sucrose in the seagrass rhizosphere was degraded by microbes, at least 1,54 million tons of carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere worldwide,” says Liebeke. “That’s roughly equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by 330,000 cars in a year.”Seagrasses are rapidly declining in all oceans, and annual losses are estimated to be as high as 7% at some sites,­ comparable to the loss of coral reefs and tropical rainforests. Up to a third of the world’s seagrass might have been already lost. “We do not know as much about seagrass as we do about land-based habitats,” Sogin emphasizes. “Our study contributes to our understanding of one of the most critical coastal habitats on our planet, and highlights how important it is to preserve these blue carbon ecosystems.”Reference: “Sugars dominate the seagrass rhizosphere” by E.

"4","Identifying Global Poverty From Space – Estimating Worldwide Economic Wellbeing","A new study led by International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) researchers proposes a novel method to estimate global economic wellbeing using nighttime satellite images.Despite successes in reducing poverty globally in the last two decades, almost one billion people still live without access to reliable and affordable electricity, which in turn negatively affects health and welfare, and impedes sustainable development. It is critical to know where these people are located if assistance and infrastructure are to reach them. A new research study proposes a novel method to estimate global economic wellbeing using nighttime satellite images.For nearly 30 years, researchers have used satellite images of Earth at night to study human activity, and it is well established that these images – commonly referred to as nighttime radiance or nighttime lights – can help map issues such as economic growth, poverty, and inequality, particularly in areas where data is scarce.Unlit locations at night in underdeveloped nations often imply low development, whereas brilliantly lighted areas suggest highly developed places, such as capital cities with rich infrastructure.Traditionally, researchers have been more interested in using the data collected from the lit areas with unlit areas typically being disregarded. In their new study that will be published today (May 5, 2022) in the journal Nature Communications, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) researchers and colleagues from several other institutions, however, specifically focused on the data from the unlit areas to estimate global economic wellbeing.“Whereas previous work has focused more on the relationship between lit areas and economic development, we found that it actually also works the other way around and that unlit areas are a good indicator of poverty. By identifying those unlit areas we can target interventions for poverty alleviation and places to focus on to improve energy access,” explains study author and IIASA Strategic Initiatives Program Director, Steffen Fritz.The researchers used a harmonized geospatial wealth index for households in various countries across Africa, Asia, and the Americas calculated by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program, which places individual households on a continuous scale of relative wealth from poorer to richer. They then combined this data with data from satellite images of global nighttime lights in these countries and found that 19% of the planet’s total settlement footprint had no detectable artificial radiance associated with it. The majority of unlit settlement footprints were found in Africa (39%) and Asia (23%). If only rural unlit infrastructure is considered, these numbers rise to 65% for Africa and 40% for Asia. In almost all countries, the results indicate a clear association between increasing percentages of unlit communities in a country and decreasing economic wellbeing levels.“We were able to map and predict the wealth class of around 2.4 million households for 49 countries spread across Africa, Asia, and the Americas based on the percentage of unlit settlements detected using nighttime light satellite images with an overall accuracy of 87%. Surprisingly, there were also relatively large amounts of unlit settlements in developed countries, in particular Europe. There can be several reasons for this result, including the fact that the satellite overpass is after midnight, but it could also be due to conscientious energy and cost saving policies in Europe by homeowners, governments, and industry,” says IIASA Novel Data Ecosystems for Sustainability Research Group Leader, Ian McCallum, who led the study.The researchers note that government agencies typically prioritize expanding electricity access for urban, rather than rural areas. Rural electrification however holds great promise for increasing wellbeing and can also have significant positive impacts in terms of household income, expenditure, health, and education. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically include “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” and while efforts are underway to achieve this goal, and substantial progress has been made over the past two decades, indications are that governments and industry will struggle to keep pace with expected population growth.In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, projections indicate that over 300 million people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to push an additional 88 to 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2030, setting back the UN’s goals to reduce poverty by around three years. Studies like this one can however help track developing countries as they electrify and developed nations as they reduce their light-energy consumption.“If applied over time, the method we used in our study could provide opportunities to track wellbeing and progress toward the SDGs. In terms of policy, it can help better inform energy policy around the globe and can also be helpful in shaping aid policy by ensuring that we are reaching those remote rural areas that are likely energy poor. In addition, it could be useful to detect signs of sustainable and environmental management of lighting in the developed world,” concludes Transformative Institutional and Social Solutions Research Group Leader, Shonali Pachauri.Reference: “Estimating global economic well-being with unlit settlements” by Ian McCallum, Christopher Conrad Maximillian Kyba, Juan Carlos Laso Bayas, Elena Moltchanova, Matt Cooper, Jesus Crespo Cuaresma, Shonali Pachauri, Linda See, Olga Danylo, Inian Moorthy, Myroslava Lesiv, Kimberly Baugh, Christopher D.
